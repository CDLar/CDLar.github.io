          2018-2019 BCFHL Draft Studs<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Vladimir Tarasenko (StL F - 37.0 fpts) - Team Mann (12) </h3>
        As is tradition in fantasy hockey, as soon as Cam traded away Tarasenko he instantly turned into the hottest
        sniper in the NHL. Tarasenko has been nothing short of disgusting and somehow instead of cooling off just keeps
        getting hotter with consecutive multi-point nights.
        <h3><br />
          2. Nikita Kucherov (TB F - 33.6 fpts) - Team Brawn (6) </h3>
        I don't think Geoff is taking home the Henicup this year and Kucherov is most of the reason why, this guy is
        practically a fantasy team by himself. Averaging almost 13 points over the last week is nutty for any fantasy
        player.
        <h3><br />
          3. Sidney Crosby (Pit F - 33.4 fpts) - Team Buckley (10) </h3>
        Crosby making the rounds again at No. 3, while a cut under the level of the truly elite this season Crosby has
        still had really solid production all-in-all.
        <h3><br />
          4. Jordan Binnington (StL G - 31.2 fpts) - Team Scheuermann (22) </h3>
        Team 100% free agency goalie core living up to its name. Tim maybe not have had much luck with Jake Allen but
        Binnington is looking to be everything he wanted in a Blues goaltender, at least for the time being. With the
        offense in St. Louis cranked up to ten you can expect a 'W' pretty much regardless of who's starting so
        Binnington should retain good value as long as he has the starting job locked down.
        <h3><br />
          5. Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB G - 31.0 fpts) - Team Mann (13) </h3>
        Mann strikes again with his signature first round pick. Vasilevskiy still holds the throne as the top fantasy
        goaltender right now even despite earlier setbacks and there's practically no one safer from being challenged
        for the starting gig.
        <h3><br />
          6. Kris Letang (Pit D - 30.8 fpts) - Team Mann (14) </h3>
        Another immensely important piece of Mann's team patched together largely through trades, while Letang comes
        with a lot of inherent risk as long as he can stay healthy on the Pens top PP there's no denying he's an
        offensive monster from the blueline.
        <h3><br />
          7. Evgeni Malkin (Pit F - 26.2 fpts) - Team Erlandson (18) </h3>
        The final member of the Pitsburg Penguins to make the top 10 this week, Malkin has always been a dynamic fantasy
        player and usually a lot more accessible in the draft compared to other elite forwards. Similar to Letang, as
        long as he's healthy he should be producing at a good rate.
        <h3><br />
          8. Alex Pietrangelo (StL D - 25.6 fpts) - Team Brawn (7) </h3>
        For maybe the first time ever team Brawn hits the list twice in a week, granted Pietrangelo is definitely no
        superstar. He's had some ups and downs over the past few years but usually maintains some baseline consistency
        at least (though definitely not enough to warrant a 4th round pick in my opinion). He's really benefitting off
        the recent Blue's offensive surge but I imagine once that fizzles out his points will start to taper off again.
        <h3><br />
          9. Steven Stamkos (TB F - 25.2 fpts) - Team Erlandson (19) </h3>
        Rik's one-two punch from his top forward draft picks really helped him pull ahead in his weekly matchup against
        KV. After debatably underperforming in the 2018 season Stamkos seems to be on regaining some of his former glory
        as one of the best offensive threats in the league.
        <h3><br />
          10. Alex Ovechkin (Wsh F - 24.2 fpts) - Team Larsen (13) </h3>
        Ovechkin is back in the top 10 after seeing a small lull in his performance throughout January. The Russian
        power forward just keeps on delivering no matter how poorly his team is doing.
