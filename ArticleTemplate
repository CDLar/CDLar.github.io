        The 2019 regular season is almost at an end and what a ride it's been. I don't think there has ever been a more
        competitive league than the 2019 season and I think that's great for both the league and the GMs in it. A few
        teams have already secured their spot either at the top or the bottom of the brackets but a giant question mark
        still remains for many teams stuck in the middle. The remaining two weeks are going to be a matter of life-and-death for many .500ish teams.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Vladimir Tarasenko (StL F - 37.0 fpts) - Team Mann (12) </h3>
        As is tradition in fantasy hockey, as soon as Cam traded away Tarasenko he instantly turned into the hottest
        sniper in the NHL. Tarasenko has been nothing short of disgusting and somehow instead of cooling off just keeps
        getting hotter with consecutive multi-point nights.
        <h3><br />
          2. Nikita Kucherov (TB F - 33.6 fpts) - Team Brawn (6) </h3>
        I don't think Geoff is taking home the Henicup this year and Kucherov is most of the reason why, this guy is
        practically a fantasy team by himself. Averaging almost 13 points over the last week is nutty for any fantasy
        player.
        <h3><br />
          3. Sidney Crosby (Pit F - 33.4 fpts) - Team Buckley (10) </h3>
        Crosby making the rounds again at No. 3, while a cut under the level of the truly elite this season Crosby has
        still had really solid production all-in-all.
        <h3><br />
          4. Jordan Binnington (StL G - 31.2 fpts) - Team Scheuermann (22) </h3>
        Team 100% free agency goalie core living up to its name. Tim maybe not have had much luck with Jake Allen but
        Binnington is looking to be everything he wanted in a Blues goaltender, at least for the time being. With the
        offense in St. Louis cranked up to ten you can expect a 'W' pretty much regardless of who's starting so
        Binnington should retain good value as long as he has the starting job locked down.
        <h3><br />
          5. Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB G - 31.0 fpts) - Team Mann (13) </h3>
        Mann strikes again with his signature first round pick. Vasilevskiy still holds the throne as the top fantasy
        goaltender right now even despite earlier setbacks and there's practically no one safer from being challenged
        for the starting gig.
        <h3><br />
          6. Kris Letang (Pit D - 30.8 fpts) - Team Mann (14) </h3>
        Another immensely important piece of Mann's team patched together largely through trades, while Letang comes
        with a lot of inherent risk as long as he can stay healthy on the Pens top PP there's no denying he's an
        offensive monster from the blueline.
        <h3><br />
          7. Evgeni Malkin (Pit F - 26.2 fpts) - Team Erlandson (18) </h3>
        The final member of the Pitsburg Penguins to make the top 10 this week, Malkin has always been a dynamic fantasy
        player and usually a lot more accessible in the draft compared to other elite forwards. Similar to Letang, as
        long as he's healthy he should be producing at a good rate.
        <h3><br />
          8. Alex Pietrangelo (StL D - 25.6 fpts) - Team Brawn (7) </h3>
        For maybe the first time ever team Brawn hits the list twice in a week, granted Pietrangelo is definitely no
        superstar. He's had some ups and downs over the past few years but usually maintains some baseline consistency
        at least (though definitely not enough to warrant a 4th round pick in my opinion). He's really benefitting off
        the recent Blue's offensive surge but I imagine once that fizzles out his points will start to taper off again.
        <h3><br />
          9. Steven Stamkos (TB F - 25.2 fpts) - Team Erlandson (19) </h3>
        Rik's one-two punch from his top forward draft picks really helped him pull ahead in his weekly matchup against
        KV. After debatably underperforming in the 2018 season Stamkos seems to be on regaining some of his former glory
        as one of the best offensive threats in the league.
        <h3><br />
          10. Alex Ovechkin (Wsh F - 24.2 fpts) - Team Larsen (13) </h3>
        Ovechkin is back in the top 10 after seeing a small lull in his performance throughout January. The Russian
        power forward just keeps on delivering no matter how poorly his team is doing.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Scheuermann - <i>Championship Frontrunner</i> (11-8-0)</h3>
        On top of already being known for pretty strong draft's team Scheuermann has found tremendous success
        this year in Free Agency with Chabot still producing at an insane level and now a string of strong performances
        from a purely free agent goalie core. Although the honors of best record in the league go to team Mann I think
        it's still safe to say Team
        Scheuermann is the favourite going into the 2019 Championship. Although he's suffered a few losses lately his
        Points For has spiked to almost 300 fantasy points over second place and nearly 1000 over Mau who is currently
        trailing in last. It's not hard to see why Tim's scoring output has really pulled ahead, so many of his players
        are sporting fantays averages of over 4, he owns most of the top guns on Boston and has a powerhouse of a
        defensive core.

        Honorable mention to Geoff who's name has actually become unironic with the longest winstreak in the league
        right now. Came a little too late though as he's still guaranteed Henicup contention.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Buckley - <i>Henicup Bound?</i> (9-10-0)</h3>
        The East division has been neck and neck this year, culminating in a four team season-end scramble to dodge
        Henicup contention. With Team Leis and Brawn having already secured their spot in the Henicup battle, two more
        people are still
        going to have to bite the bullet. Of those in contention Team Buckey already has the disadvantage of being at 9
        wins instead of 10 compared to other teams and to make matters worse he's on a league-leading 4 week slide.
        Tweak is currently rostering 6 players with an average of under 3 Fantasy Points which is a place you don't
        really want to find yourself when competition is so stiff. Tweak either needs to make some roster shake-ups
        happen or hope he's struggling players turn it around for him in this critical weeks.
