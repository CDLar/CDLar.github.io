      <h1>Week Five Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="05/11/2018">Nov. 5, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to week five of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a look at featured GMs, and see who's got the best predictions. Interestingly there's not many stars
        to be see this week, the Top 10 is populated mostly by some secondary scorers on lucky streaks as most of the
        dominant scorers in
        the league were pretty quiet.

        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Elias Lindholm (Cgy C/RW - 28.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (6)
        </h3>
        The Calgary top line really did some damage this week with Lindholm really reaping the benefits. Hard to
        complain
        when a free agent pick-up ends up netting you almost 30 points in one week.
        <h3><br />
          2. Ryan McDonagh (TB D - 28.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (7)
        </h3>
        Erlandson is making a pretty good push for Top 10 leader with another entry in McDonagh. Former ranger was
        never overly impressive
        in past years but maybe his current line assignment could be a lot more favorable for him.
        <h3><br />
          3. Mark Giordano (Cgy D - 27.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Larsen (4)
        </h3>
        Looks like Gio still has some gas left in the tank, 6 points in a week as well as a point-per-game pace so far
        this season. It's unlikely he'll hold this pace but the veteran is still logging big minutes and making an
        impact on the ice.
        <h3><br />
          4. Cam Fowler (Ana D - 27.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Snyder (1)
        </h3>
        With Cam finally entering the top 10 I believe that means everyone is now on the board. D-men seem to really be
        killing it this week, Fowler notches 3 goals in week which is a pretty impressive number for someone you'd
        probably
        expect to playing more of a shut down role.
        <h3><br />
          5. Sean Monahan (Col RW - 26.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (5)
        </h3>
        The third member of the Calgary squad to land on the list. Ironically the guy you expect to be generating the
        value, Johnny Gaudreau, is absent form
        the list and instead we have Monahan. Sean will have good fantasy value as long as he sits on the top line/1PP
        and it's unlikely anything will shake him from that role.

        <h3><br />
          6. Elias Pettersson (Van C - 25.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (6)
        </h3>
        Petterson is back to a great start after a quick injury hiatus, my guess if you were interested in trading this
        guy from Tim the
        price just went up. Elias managed 5 points in a single night which a lot of elite players even struggle to do,
        this guy could be
        the real deal for a sans Sedin Vancouver.
        <h3><br />
          7. Pekka Rinne (Nsh G - 25.2 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Menna (4)
        </h3>
        Rinne has been the preds workhorse for years and despite being 36 now it looks like he's still going strong.
        Rinne turned away 65 out 66 shots he faced in his first
        two games back from injury.
        <h3><br />
          8. Dylan Larkin (Det C - 24.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team KV (3)
        </h3>
        Another late round pick showing up huge, the Detroit offense does not look good this season, they just don't
        really have that many
        big offensive threats now that the glory days of Datsyuk/Zetterberg have come to an end. Larkin is basically
        one of the only players on Detroit who
        you can expect to get any consistent fantasy value out of.

        <h3><br />
          9. Brayden Point (TB C - 23.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (7)
        </h3>
        It was a good week for Team Scheuermann as Point makes for his third entry on the Top 10. After a great season
        for me last year I was
        looking for Point in the draft but he went over to Tim before I could get the chance. Even though he's on the
        second line the lightning has such terrifying offense on their
        top line that he's likely never going to go up against top shutdown lines which helps him generate a lot of
        offense.
        <h3><br />
          10. Patrik Laine (StL Rw, C - 23.2 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Leis (2)
        </h3>
        Laine finally explodes into action after looking terrible for most of the beginning of the season. Laine hits
        the top ten despite
        only playing two games after scoring a hat trick in a huge night against Florida.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Scheuermann - <i>Consistent performance </i> (3-2-0)</h3>
        Now while Tim did suffer two losses early on in the season I think you gotta give credit where credit is due, Tim has the championship-winning
        pedigree and a ton of hockey knowledge. Most of the season Tim's team has bounced between average and high scores, his team doesn't often
        suffer really bad weaks because I think he's made a solid team that's well balanced across the positions and NHL teams. Tim has established a really
        solid floor for his team which still threatens high scoring weeks if you get unlucky. He was probably hoping for more out of his first round pick but there's still
        a lot of season left for Karlsson to start generating some more value.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Buckley - <i>Inflated record</i> (3-2-0)</h3>
        Now what I mean by inflated is that I think that Tweak is one of the teams that has gotten off to a hot start that
        will start to come to earth sooner rather than later.
        Right now Tweak is posting a positive win rate despite being the 4th lowest teams for points for, in fact he's
        only 60 points off the current lowest point leader(the title is held by Cam whos situation is similar).

      <h1>Week Four Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="29/10/2018">Oct. 29, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to week four of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a look at featured GMs, and see who's got the best predictions. The standings are quite interesting so far
        with some top spots going to unlikely GMs. However it's important to realize that it's early in the season and
        there are
        definitely some discrepancies between total PF and current record and I expect that by week 10 there should be
        a much clearer
        picture of who's making the top 6 playoff spots and who's running the gauntlet or finding themselves in Henicup
        contention.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Brent Burns (SJ D - 29.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (3)
        </h3>
        I'm sure a lot of people were curious how the Burns/Karlsson would pan out but so far it looks like
        Burns is winning out fantasy-wise. Burns has always been one of the top-performers in the league
        and this is proof why, 6 points in a week is a lot of fantasy value for skaters who get access to those extra
        DEF points. Of course because it's Burns you know a lot of those are coming on the PP as well.
        <h3><br />
          2. Filip Forsberg (Nsh C/LW - 27.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (4)
        </h3>
        Morgo picks up the second spot as well with Forsberg who potted 5 goals on the week. The young Swede
        has a ton of talent and you can expect a lot of the offensive coming out of Nashville to be generated by him.
        <h3><br />
          3. Sidney Crosby (Pit C - 27 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Buckley (3)
        </h3>
        Honestly there are times where I've felt like Crosby was a little overvalued as a first-round pick in fantasy
        because he tends to
        accumulate more assists than goals but that's definitely not the case this week after tallying five goals in
        three games on top of two assists.
        <h3><br />
          4. Connor McDavid (Edm C - 26.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Leis (1)
        </h3>
        It took four weeks but Mau has finally landed on the top 10, of course owning McDavid meant this moment was
        inevitable. McDavid broke 400 Fpts last year, it's insane to think that there's even potential to improve on
        that even exists.
        <h3><br />
          5. Mikko Rantanen (Col RW - 25.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Mann (4)
        </h3>
        The Colorado offense has been crushing it lately, for an 8th round pick Rantanen has been performing
        great for Mann. As long as he keeps playing with MacKinnon he should keep producing at a good rate.

        <h3><br />
          6. Mark Scheifele (Wpg C - 25 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Synder (1)
        </h3>
        Another new GM on the top 10 as Cam makes his first appearance. Scheifele enjoyed an easy schedule last week
        playing four games against teams that tend to let a lot
        of pucks in. Scheifele didn't have any massive games but rather just consistly contributed to all 4 of his
        games played.
        <h3><br />
          7. Timo Meier (SJ LW/RW - 24 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (5)
        </h3>
        The Sharks have so much offense that even players on secondary scoring lines can rack up a lot of
        fantasy points. Despite not getting top line pairings he still gets to play even-strength with Couture and
        earns a little bit of 2PP time.
        <h3><br />
          8. Anders Lee (NYI C/LW - 23.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mann (5)
        </h3>
        I think a lot of people expected the value of Lee to plummet with the trading of Tavares but as much
        as a fantasy boon it was to play with Tavares you also need to consider that his departure leaves a huge
        gap in production that needs to be filled by someone. Lee isn't a flashy player but he still manages to get a
        lot of points grinding the dirty zones in front of the net.
        <h3><br />
          9. Patrick Kane (Chi R - 22.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Larsen (3)
        </h3>
        The Chicago offense continues to look alive and thriving, Kane already has 19 points so far this season, will
        he be able to return back to the glory days of his 100 point season after a disappointing 2018 campaign?
        <h3><br />
          10. Ryan O'Reilly (StL Rw, C - 22.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Erlandson (5)
        </h3>
        The Blues seem to be going through a bit of a rough patch to start the season off but it doesn't seem to be
        effecting
        ROR this week. He came out strong with 6 points and +6 rating.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Le Fevre - <i>leads league in goals </i> (3-1-0)</h3>
        Sporting a pretty nice 3-1 opening record must be feeling pretty good considering his past legacy of Henicup
        contention.
        It's hard to give him too much credit seeing as his team was basically auto-drafted but so far his players have
        been on a great scoring run,
        he leads the league in goals scored as well as hat tricks. Definitely the kind of categories you want to target
        during the regular season. Overall Morgo's PF is average so it's likely that at his current rate he won't hold
        one of the top division spots for long but its still possible that Morgo avoids the Henicup race this year and
        establishes himself as a mid-tier team.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Leis - <i>Winless, lowest PF </i>(0-0-4)</h3>
        I'm a little bit surprised as I thought relative to his other seasons his draft actually seemed to be not that
        terrible however it really seems like Mau's team is just snakebitten right now. Mau has so many underperforming
        players on his team currently, not to mention his 2nd round pick, Laine was recently demoted to the 4th line.
        Other players like Kopitar, Hamilton and Provorov are also doing poorly out of the gate. To make matters worse,
        Radulov, one of his more consistent players is out on injury right now. Until his players start picking it up
        Mau is really looking like a free win.

      <h1>Week Three Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="22/10/2018">Oct. 22, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Here we go again with another week of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a quick look at featured GM's in the league and now introducing a new segment the Pick'Em Prophet. As of
        last week the site now features a new match-ups section with a recently renovated look, in the wrap-up we're
        going to see who had the best predictions over the last week.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Gabriel Landeskog (Col LW - 35.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Erlandson (2)
        </h3>
        Team Erlandson came out in force this week, refusing to be taken down to an 0-0-3 start. Landeskog
        earned more than 10 more fantasy points than the second ranked player on the list and played a huge role in
        Erik's monster 238 point week. At only 25, Landeskog is looking like he could demolish
        past career highs playing with the likes of Mackinnon and Rantanen.
        <h3><br />
          2. Jeff Skinner (Buf LW - 24 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Buckley (2)
        </h3>
        Skinner has a pretty nice line assignment playing with up-and-coming star Jack Eichel. Skinner has
        traditionally
        looked good in past seasons but it always seems like it's just a matter of time before a random head shot
        takes him out for the season.
        We'll see if Skinner can make it safely through the 2019 season but I wouldn't bet on it.


        <h3><br />
          3. Logan Couture (SJ C - 23.4 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Sunny (6)
        </h3>
        Couture was a force of nature out on the ice this week landing at the 3rd spot with only two games played.
        Couture is one of those
        guys who always seems poised to have a huge breakout into elite status every year but it never quite comes to
        fruition. That being
        said his floor has always been pretty solid and he presents a lot of potential upside for a ninth round pick.
        Also worth noting that
        Couture is the first non-leaf to earn a top 10 point for Sunny.
        <h3><br />
          4. Nathan MacKinnon (Col C - 22.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Menna (3)
        </h3>
        Menna is quietly acruing top 10 points with another from MacKinnon. There's no doubt MacKinnon is a monster and
        is likely
        to frequent the wrap-up all season long after his huge break out last season. He dishes out a little bit of
        everything and
        drives a lot of the Colorado offense, he's a very safe bet to finish the season as a top 10 skater overall.
        <h3><br />
          5. Zach Parise (Min LW - 21 fpts - GP: 4) - Team KV (2)
        </h3>
        With a four game schedule it was a smart move for KV to pick up Parise at the start of the week but I don't
        think anyone
        would have expected him to be this week. You definitely have to give a special shout-out when a FA acquisition
        lands
        so high on the top 10 board. Parise's 10 blocked shots accounted for 4 fpts (roughly 20% of his weekly fpts)
        which is an absurdly high number for a forward. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to take home the 'W' for KV but
        you
        still gotta give props.

        <h3><br />
          6. Juuse Saros (Nsh G - 21 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Mann (3)
        </h3>
        The first goalie to grace Week 3 of the weekly top ten is who? None other than Nashville back-up Juuse Saros on
        relief duty
        for Pekka Rinne. Saros actually picks up a very easy win after stopping the remaining 9 shots against Calgary
        in the game
        that Rinne was injured. He did
        earn his spot here however by turning away 31 shots from McDavid and Co. Saros is definitely turing out to be a
        good
        goalie to
        stream in the absence of Rinne.
        <h3><br />
          7. Tyler Johnson (TB C/RW - 21.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (4)
        </h3>
        Damn this guy puts a lot of pucks on net, Johnson fired exactly 17 this week which is what you want to see out
        of a player
        on a high-octane
        offensive team like the Lightning. Johnson has no assists to speak of this week but you're definitely going to
        value
        those G's higher anyways. A quick short-handed goal doesn't hurt to pump up your weekly stats either.
        <h3><br />
          8. Keith Yandle (Fla D - 20.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Brawn (1)
        </h3>
        After 3 weeks Geoff finally earns a spot on the wrap-up (well technically he gets one more mention but we'll
        get to that later). It must have been a little troubling to see Florida rolling out a 5 Forward power-play unit
        without Yandle at the start of the season but it looks like he's doing alright now contributing a healthy
        amount of
        stats across the board including 5 points.
        <h3><br />
          9 (Tie). Devan Dubnyk (Min G - 20 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Larsen (3)
        </h3>
        Dubnyk is in my opinion quite under-rated, he currently sits second overall among fantasy tenders. While the
        wild are not
        a particularly dominant team, Dubnyk always tends to post a pretty good SV% and GAA. Dubnyk has no #2 breathing
        down his neck
        and will take on the majority of starts, it's just up to the Wild to win the games so Dubnyk can reap the
        points for the 'W'.
        <h3><br />
          9 (Tie). P.K. Subban (Nsh D - 20 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Erlandson (3)
        </h3>
        Though it's a bit surprising to see Subban with only 1 hit throughout the whole week he's still putting a lot
        of shots on net which
        is to be expected from the talented offensive blue-liner. A lot of Subban's fantasy value this week comes from
        a break out end-to-end
        short-handed goal beating the Edmonton goalie with a quick snap through the 5-hole.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Mann - <i>Pun game on point</i> (3-0-0)</h3>
        The reigning Basecamp Fantasy Champion is starting the new season hot picking up wins in all of his contests so
        far. He looks to continue
        his win streak against a battered (0-0-3) Kyle Varley. Despite an unorthodox draft where he didn't even pick up
        his first forward until the 5th round he is somehow generating tons of offense from his mid and late round
        picks. Ironically
        his first and second round goalie picks have been sub-par so far which means that his team is still capable of
        being even stronger once
        they eventually rebound and start playing well. Mann has gotten a lot of unexpected value out of the likes of
        Petry and Saros but these will obviously come
        to an end once their injured counter-parts bump them back down the line-up. You really got to respect what Mann
        brings to the name game, fantasy Team Names have always been a cornerstone of the BCFL and Mann has been
        bringing his A-game
        so far this season.
        <br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Brawn - <i>Hard shell taco enthusiast </i>(0-0-3)</h3>
        Geoff is the only other member of the league to remain winless after three contests, the only difference
        between him and KV is that is actually
        seems like he might actually stay that way. Fuck this seems pretty fitting when you consider that Geoff is
        almost already at a -100 point differential
        between him and his opponnents by only the third week. Geoff's draft is mostly to blame with a lot of his
        mid-round picks hardly performing better
        than what's currently available on FA. The only thing that I like about Geoff's team is that he's still trying
        to make moves to patch up his squad. He recently picked up Lowry from the Jets who have an amazing four game
        schedule this week and I think could
        could end up being a pretty smart move for Geoff in the short-term.

      <h1>Week Two Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="15/10/2018">Oct. 15, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to the second week of the Basecamp Fantasy Wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice and a quick look at featured GM's in the league. More than half of this week's top line-up is made by
        Boston/Toronto, I added a games played metric to the top 10 and we'll be looking at the Varley brothers in the
        GM Spotlight.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Patrice Bergeron (Bos C - 34 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (2)
        </h3>
        The fact that the top spot this week goes to Bergeron despite only getting in 3 games compared to the leafs 4
        is pretty impressive. The Boston offense was firing on all cylinders this week, though it could be argued that
        they didn't face very tough opposition. Bergeron killed it across multiple cats including a hat trick against
        Ottawa earlier in the week.
        <h3><br />
          2. David Pastrnak (Bos LW/RW - 32 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (2)
        </h3>
        Pasta grants Morgo his debut on the top 10 with a whopping 6 goals including a hat trick against detroit. He
        wasn't as active in the assist column but with those kind of points you probably aren't going to care too much.
        Pastrnak has been one of the more consistent fantasy powerhouses in the last few seasons and it definitely
        won't be his last time up here.
        <h3><br />
          3. Auston Matthews (Tor C - 26.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Sunny (4)
        </h3>
        Matts once again finding himself high up on the board, it doesn't hurt that the leafs got to enjoy four games
        this week. It's really looking
        like the offensive core of the leafs are going to be more or less permenant mainstays on the top 10 which has
        to have Sunny feeling pretty good about his team.
        <h3><br />
          4. Sebastion Aho (Car RW/C - 24 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mann (2)
        </h3>
        Despite never fully realizing his potential last year Mann takes another chance on Aho and it seems to be
        paying off so far.
        Aho put up a huge variety of stats this week, getting a surprising number of hits and blocks in as well which
        are definitely a nice bonus on top of the regular point production Aho offers.
        <h3><br />
          5. Phil Kessel (Pit RW - 23.2 fpts - GP: 4) - Team KV (1)
        </h3>
        Kessel seems to be settling in much better on the Penguins where he's out of the main spotlight with the likes
        of Crosby and Malkin around. Kessel still has a wicked shot and lots of opportunities playing with the Pens to
        quietly rack up a lot of points. He also marks KV's entry on the top 10 board.
        <h3><br />
          6. David Perron (Stl LW - 22 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (2)
        </h3>
        Morgo had a huge 200+ week partially due to his FA pick-up of Perron. At just 20% owned Morgo definitely got
        some value out of this guy as he notches a hat trick against the Calgary squad. Whether not Morgo could have
        anticipated
        the impact of Perron, he definitely played a crucial role in his close match-up over KV.
        <h3><br />
          7. John Tavares (Tor C - 21.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Sunny (5)
        </h3>
        Sunny is really starting to break away on the top 10 here, already at 5 points as Tavares hits the board for
        the second week in a row.
        With how stacked the Toronto offense is looking a third week wouldn't surprise me.
        <h3><br />
          8. Evgeny Kuznetsov (Wsh C - 20.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Menna (2)
        </h3>
        The Russian stud making his first appearance in week 2. He's flanked by the likes of Ovechkin and capable
        of scoring goals and dishing out assists equally, Kuznetsov is about as safe as it comes for guaranteed weekly
        production.
        <h3><br />
          9. Brad Marchand (Bos LW - 18.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (3)
        </h3>
        Loved by few, hated by many, but undeniably a rock solid fantasy producer. For a while it seemed like there was
        a period where
        no one could really believe he was an elite fantasy prospect but synergy in Boston among the top 6 and PP has
        really
        clicked and Marchand has a fat assist column to show for it.
        <h3><br />
          10. Alex DeBrincat (Chi RW - 18.8 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Menna (3)
        </h3>
        The sole player with only two games played to make the top 10, DeBrinecat has played a large role in the
        rejuvination of the
        Chicago offense. He's really proving himself playing alongside top talent on the Blackhawks, for being such a
        late pick in the draft he could end up being a clutch sleeper pick for Menna.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Varley (Sr.) - <i>Two win streak</i> (2-0-0)</h3>
        If there were ever a year to be a leafs homer in a fantasy league this is it. The leafs offense looks almost
        unstoppable and Sunny somehow ended up with all the core pieces minus maybe Marner. After losing against Sunny
        earlier in the week I got to say you really dread every night there's a leaf game because you know his guys can
        net 20-30 points easily in one game. That being said, the traditional weaknesses of stacking up on one team
        still apply;
        whenever the leafs find themselves with a light schedule it's hard to say if Sunny's team has the depth to
        stand up to the
        other powerhouses in the league. I don't think the leafs offense will ever find itself completely shut down so
        I think he
        should be safe from that at least.
        <br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Varley (Jr.) - <i>Two loss streak</i> (0-0-2)</h3>
        Three-time Basecamp Fantasy Champion finds himself in a less-than-ideal situation as the beginning of the
        season unfolds. Back-to-back losses is a bad spot to find yourself at the start of the season, especially
        with a tough
        match-up against former Champion Evan Mann just around the corner, but other GMs
        have come back from worse. KV is undoubtedly upset with the situation having taken to WhatsApp to express his
        outrage over his close defeat to
        Team Le Fevre. The only positive spin is that in terms of points for, which are usually a more accurate measure
        of strength, KV is still
        putting up a decent performance.

      <h1>Week One Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="08/10/2018">Oct. 8, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome to the first official Basecamp Fantasy Wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the ice and a
        quick look at featured GM's in the league. You can expect one of these coming your way every week, where I'll
        be ranking the weekly top 10 players in the league based on fantasy points and awarding points to their
        respective owners. <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Auston Matthews (Tor C - 30 fpts) - Team Sunny (1)
        </h3>
        What a monstrous week for Big Papi netting a league leading 5 goals and 3 assists to boot. Taken once again in
        the first round by Sunny, there's no way the addition of Tavares doesn't boost the firepower of the leafs and
        push Matthews to even higher heights.
        <h3><br />
          2. Morgan Rielly (Tor D - 29.4 fpts) - Team Sunny (2)
        </h3>
        Not who you would expect to top the fantasy charts for D-men going into week 2 but here he is. Definitely got a
        big boost from the 7 goal game against Chicago, we'll see how much he can improve on last year's season.
        <h3><br />
          3. Jonathan Toews (Chi C - 26.4 fpts) - Team Sunny (3)
        </h3>
        Perhaps the most surprising player to land on the top 10 is Toews, who has become notorious over the years for
        having bad fantasy value despite being a great real-life player. Most of his points were generated from his hat
        trick against St. Louis. Considering he was drafted 171st overall, if Chicago can keep ramping up its offense
        Toews could turn out to be an insane value pick for Sunny.
        <h3><br />
          4. John Gibson (Ana G - 24 fpts) - Team Erlandson (1)
        </h3>
        Gibson is a goalie with a crazy amount of upside, I really Rik's move to grab a goalie like Gibson in the 3rd
        who can easily compete with the elite goalies who went in earlier rounds and free up his 1st and 2nd picks for
        other positions.
        <h3><br />
          5. Patrick Kane (Chi RW - 23 fpts) - Team Larsen (1)
        </h3>
        The former first rounder got passed by until the third round after a lackluster 2017-2018 season and on a team
        with deteriorating offensive capabiltiies. So far he's proving he still has what it takes to be elite.
        <h3><br />
          6. John Tavares (Tor C - 21.8 fpts) - Team Sunny (4)
        </h3>
        Sunny's 4th player to hit the top 10 and rank 6 overall, John Tavares. Tavares is wasting no time adjusting by
        scoring a hat trick against the blackhawks, with the sheer amount of offensive power the leafs have this season
        I expect Tavares to be a regular customer on the top 10.
        <h3><br />
          7. T.J. Oshie (Wsh C/RW - 20.4 fpts) - Team Buckley (1)
        </h3>
        Oshie will bump Team Buckley onto the scoreboard but I don't particularly expect to see him up here too often.
        That being said Oshie has good stat coverage and the Capitals 1PP is dangerous.
        <h3><br />
          8. John Carlson (Wsh D - 19.2 fpts) - Team Scheuermann (1)
        </h3>
        A great 4th round pick in my opinion, Carlson put up career high points last year and at I don't expect much in
        the way of regression.
        <h3><br />
          9. Tyler Seguin (Dal C - 18.8 fpts) - Team Menna (1)
        </h3>
        Everyone knows the Benn/Seguin duo is deadly, particularly on the PP. I expect to see these two guys up here a
        lot this season.
        <h3><br />
          10. Kris Letang (Pit D - 18.8 fpts) - Team Mann (1)
        </h3>
        Sucks for Morgo.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Erlandson</h3>
        Despite being handed a tough loss in week 1 by Sunny in a crazy Sunday comeback I think you can't really ignore
        the second highest score and that Rik has a team worth watching out for this year. Rik has been setting a trend
        of progressively becoming more and more of a playoff threat each passing year. His forward core is super solid
        with a one two punch of Malkin and Stamkos, and despite getting burned by him once myself I think he got a good
        deal on Gaudreau. As far as goalies go I think Gibson makes up for most of the shortcomings of his weaker 2nd
        and 3rd goalies. I'm not really sold on all of his D choices but it's still early in the year.
        <br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Synder</h3>
        Traditionally speaking Cam has always managed a middle of the pack team that usually goes through highs and
        lows throughout the season. Recently however he has come under fire for his draft strategy and despite picking
        up the 'W' his team had a poor first showing. Additionally, a string of early injuries to his core roster
        threatens to set him back early, definitely not a comfortable position for a regular bubble team. I actually
        don't think Cam did a bad job at all at balancing his team, it's fairly even across the positions, the only
        problem I have is that it seemed like he never really managed to any strong power picks in the middle rounds
        which just sort of leaves his team a little lacking overall.

      <h1>2018 Balance Changes</h1>
      <h2>League Announcement</h2>

      <time datetime="13/9/2018">Sept. 13, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>So after some balance talks with Tim we decided to go ahead with the following balance change:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>+/- (0.5 points) &rArr; +/- (0.2 points)</b>
        <br />
        <br /> The reason for the change was that we both felt that the plus minus stat as a whole was something we
        wanted to keep
        in the league but at the same time it felt a little too random, esepcially with forwards ending with negative
        nights.
        We decided to lower the impact of +/- to make players fantasy nights a little more consistent across the board.</p>

      <p>
        We also talked about trying to make goalies more consistent and and make lower end goalies a bit less risky to
        run out by
        reducing negative points acrued by goals against (while reducing points earned for wins) but it turned out to
        be
        too hard to balance without throwing off the balance of the elite goaltenders. We also didn't want to shake up
        the
        balance of the league too much right before the draft so we decided to keep the changes fairly light this year
        as
        we were mostly happy with how everything turned out last year.

      <p>Thanks again to KV for doing the annual draft lottery, I've added last year's draft position in brackets next
        to each
        name. This year's Basecamp Fantasy Hockey League draft pick order is as follows:
        <br />
        <br /> 1. Matt Leis (3)
        <br /> 2. Sunny Varley (1)
        <br /> 3. Geoff Charles (2)
        <br /> 4. Curtis Larsen (4)
        <br /> 5. Morgan Pierre (9)
        <br /> 6. Tim Aaron (6)
        <br /> 7. Erik Menna (11)
        <br /> 8. Morgan Noel (12)
        <br /> 9. Cameron RS (10)
        <br /> 10. Erik Mitchell (5)
        <br /> 11. Kyle Varley (8)
        <br /> 12. Evan Mann (7)
        <br />
        <br /> It's interesting to see that the top four draft picks remain unchanged and that most GMs ended up with a
        pick position
        relatively close to last year's. Rik being the only outlier here dropping five positions 5 > 10.
