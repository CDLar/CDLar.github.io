      <h1>Week Two Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up (2019-2020)</h2>

      <time datetime="22/10/2019">Oct. 22nd, 2019</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Here we are again, a little late but better than never. In a bit of a surprising turn this week is dominated by
        the likes of Team LeFevre and Team Mau. At this time Team Erlandson is the only GM without a spot on the top 10
        board. Weekly clip Ft. Jack Hughes.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Pastrnak, David (BOS F - 39.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team LeFevre (2) </h3>
        Morgo claims top spot for the second week running with Pasta. Being able to net 40 fantasy points in the span of
        three games is honestly disgusting. What's even better is that of his nine points seven of them were goals.
        <h3><br />
          2. Fleury, Marc-Andre (VGK G - 33.5 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Mau (3) </h3>
        Three out of four wins isn't bad when you're getting peppered by shots and it seems like the Golden Knights
        still have Fleury firmly slotted in as their workhorse in the crease. However, as good as it looks for now
        taking
        MAF at twenty-first overall is costly considering what else you could have had at that position.
        <h3><br />
          3. Hutton, Carter (BUF G - 30.4 fpts - GP: 2) - Team KV (1) </h3>
        As if the 25 shot shutout wasn't good enough, Carter immediately followed it up with a 47 shot shutout. Those
        are some pretty insane numbers for the Buffalo Sabres goaltender, unfortunately as long as Ullmark is still
        around taking starts It's really hard for Hutton to achieve high fantasy value.

        <h3><br />
          4. Carlson, John (WSH D - 29.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team LeFevre (3) </h3>
        Here he comes again, Carlson is still red hot after two weeks notching another seven points over three games.
        Carlson might not throw the body quite as much as some other blueliners but he's definitely one of the best
        offensive defesemen you can own right now.
        <h3><br />
          5. Rielly, Morgan (TOR D - 27.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Sunny (1) </h3>
        Jer gets his first hit on the Top 10 and who else would it be but a Maple Leaf to do it, concerns about Tyson
        Barrie eating into Reilly's icetime seem largely groundless as he continues to hold his top line and 1PP
        position. After an insane start to last year's season Reilly continues to operate at over a point-per-game pace,
        considering the value of defense points his fantasy value is still sky high in the 2019-2020 season.
        <h3><br />
          6. Stastny, Paul (VGK F - 27.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team LeFevre (4) </h3>
        Although Stastny is not exact flashy but he has good hockey sense and still gets the job done. While I don't
        think Morgo owned him for most of the week he does still get credit based on the pick-up.
        <h3><br />
          7. Ellis, Ryan (NSH D - 23.0 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mau (4) </h3>
        A bit of a surprising one here, especially with Josi being the go to guy for the Preds top PP. Ellis is still
        making it work though, and he does enjoy top pairing, although you would assume that his value will eventually
        start to fall as the 2pp unit just doesn't really stack up to the caliber of the first.
        <h3><br />
          8. Hertl, Tomas (SJ F - 22.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mau (5) </h3>
        Hertl is finally coming online after an extremely quiet start to the season popping off on a few big nights.
        It's still hard to say if Hertl will find consistency going forward, I could see him being a streakier player.
        <h3><br />
          9. Edler, Alexander (VAN D - 22.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mann (2) </h3>
        The Canucks are anything but an offensive powerhouse, but lowkey Edler continues to be a pretty valuable fantasy
        asset for anyone who owns him. Honestly after floating a 4.4 FPT avg and still sporting monster minutes for the
        2018-2019 season it's a surprise everyone passed up on him until the 18th round.
        <h3><br />
          10. Kane, Evander (SJ F - 22.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team KV (2) </h3>
        There's a lot to like about E. Kane, he covers a lot of categories and sports a high shot volume on the
        ever-dangerous San Jose squad. After coming back from his suspension Kane got a hat trick and racked up almost
        20 FPTS in a single game.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team KV - <i>Happy Birthday</i> (2-0-0)</h3>
        After a rollercoaster of a 2018-2019 fantasy year Team KV seems to have established himself as an early
        standings leader this time around. KV has a lot of strong performances early on and his team is looking fairly
        well-rounded. Although using a 5th round pick on Letang is a big risk if he can actually manage to stay healthy
        for most of the season it could end up being a great value pick, either way I like the gutsy move. One pick I'm
        less thrilled about is Holtby, I thought he was a bit of a red flag coming into the season but as long as
        Hutton, Grubauer continue to play well he should still be safe on goaltending.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Sunny - <i>Crucial Injury</i> (0-2-0)</h3>
        Team Sunny seems to be running into a few issues coming out of the gate early this season, most obvious of them
        being the injury to his early second round pick, John Tavares. The injury comes at a bad time as a lot of his
        other forwards that he's relying on for points have been fairly underwhelming so far in the season. I think the
        goalie situation will improve over time as Andersen and Price should provide good long-term value. I would
        actually say Jer has one of the better defensive cores in the league so we'll just have to see if his forwards
        can turn their puck-luck around.

      <h1>Week One Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up (2019-2020)</h2>

      <time datetime="15/10/2019">Oct. 15th, 2019</time>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Welcome back once again to a brand new year of Basecamp fantasy hockey, as always the Weekly Wrap-Up is here to
        let you know who's lighting it up the fantasy world and to take a featured look at some of the GMs in the
        league. League drama came early this year with the occurence of #DropGate2019 which was all started when GM
        Cameron Snyder, in a state of drug-fueled confusion, dropped three of his forwards including elite forward
        Brayden Point to waivers.
        Leniency was granted mostly due to everyone still getting used to the new Fantrax site and GM Snyder was allowed
        to reclaim the lost player.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. John Carlson (WSH D - 44.4 fpts - GP: 6) - Team LeFevre (1) </h3>
        Top honors in the opening week go to Carlson, with 44 fantasy points in a single (albeit extended) week what
        more can you ask for. Every year this guy consistently piles up the points, being able to get a defenseman that
        can nearly rival the likes of Burns and Karlsson in the 3rd or 4th round that's a hell of a bargain and it's no
        surprise his draft position keeps slowly creeping up every year.
        <h3><br />
          2. Connor McDavid (EDM F - 43.6 fpts - GP: 5) - Team Mau (1) </h3>
        The only surprise here is that he's not number 1, starting the season off with 12 points in five games is just
        business as usual for McDavid.
        <h3><br />
          3. Anthony Mantha (DET F - 39.4 fpts - GP: 5) - Team Mann (1) </h3>
        A sneaky reach by Mann drafting Mantha just slightly ahead of his ADP is already showing huge returns, I think a
        lot of people at least had Mantha on their radar but it was hard to predict an opening this explosive out of
        him. The Red Wings are a far cry from being an elite hockey club but you can't deny that despite their depth
        issues they have a pretty killer top line.
        <h3><br />
          4. James Neal (EDM F - 39.4 fpts - GP: 5) - Team Larsen (1) </h3>
        Back from the dead is none other than the Real Deal James Neal. With the glory days playing for the Penguins
        long gone and an absolutely abysmal 2018-2019 campaign in Calgary, I think a lot of people would have suspected
        that Neal's days of fantasy relevancy had come to an end. It's still hard to say if he will continue to be
        useful as the season progresses but anything is possible with McDavid as a linemate.
        <h3><br />
          5. Mika Zibanejad (NYR F - 39.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (1) </h3>
        Timbo's first hit on the top 10 board and what an absolute stud Zibanejad is, I really don't think you can get a
        better goal-scorer in the mid-rounds of the draft. Zibby has exceptional talent, posting a combined 8 points in
        two games including a hat-trick. He won't maintain this insane pace but I think he is a pretty safe bet to
        finish in the upper echelon of forwards this season.
        <h3><br />
          6. Dougie Hamilton (CAR D - 38.6 fpts - GP: 6) - Team Larsen (2) </h3>
        After a pretty turbulent career being bounced around the NHL from team to team it seems that Dougie has finally
        found a good assignment with the Canes. His defensive game may not be the tightest but this guy lives for
        offense and his goals and shot volume reflect that playstyle.
        <h3><br />
          7. John Gibson (ANA G - 33.3 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Larsen (3) </h3>
        Arguably one of the best goalies in the league in terms of raw talent, Gibson is unfortunately handcuffed to the
        Ducks, who have quite possibly the worst offensive team in the NHL right now. That being said, when Gibson goes
        hero mode he's bound to accumulate tons of fantasy value from the sheer number of shots he has to turn away to
        allow his team to squeak out some wins.
        <h3><br />
          8. Leon Draisaitl (EDM F - 33.2 fpts - GP: 5) - Team Snyder (1) </h3>
        I've said it twice already and I'll say it again, McDavid is pretty damn good. Now it seems that Draisaitl has
        proven that he can be a pretty decent player in his own right but it's pretty fair to assume he wouldn't be
        hitting the heights he's hitting now without number 97 around.
        <h3><br />
          9. Patrik Laine (WPG F - 33.2 fpts - GP: 6) - Team Mau (2) </h3>
        An instrumental piece in the battle of the Thompsons allowing Team Mau a narrow victory over Team Scheuermann.
        Every point matters when both teams are breaking the 300 point barrier and Laine brought plenty to the table.
        Despite being quite streaky in the past, and being one of the last notable RFA's to sign heading into the
        season, it looks like Laine has come out to play early this season.
        <h3><br />
          10. Auston Matthews (TOR F - 32.8 fpts - GP: 6.0) - Team Buckley (1) </h3>
        The Leafs offense is off to a blazing start and AM34 is a big reason why. A prolific goal scorer and
        even-strength monster, not many goalies can stop that deadly wrist-shot. After multiple seasons plagued by
        injuries the the big question with Matthews is will he be able to stay healthy this year through the whole
        season.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Erlandson - <i>Draft gameplan</i> (1-0-0)</h3>
        While GM Erlandson is not particularly known for throwing down huge blockbusters like some of the other
        consistently top-performing teams, GM Erlandson still manages to find his way into the playoff bracket year
        after year.
        I think a large part of that is due to his very consistent draft strategy, and his ability to build a
        well-rounded team across all the positions. Erlandson has the proven firepower in the likes of Burns, Marchand,
        Gaudreau and Hall and is packing some good rebound potential in the later round pickups of Benn and
        Gostisbehere. I could see goaltending be a potential weakness with an aging Rinne and Vancouver and Philadelphia
        not being the strongest clubs but so far they have looked more than serviceable.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Snyder - <i>Not to be confused with Cam's Team</i> (0-1-0)</h3>
        Even ignoring the events of #DropGate2019, GM Snyder finds himself with the lowest Points For over the first
        week and having Point in the line-up wouldn't have changed the fact either. Outside of a few guys like Ovechkin
        and Draisaitl who you know are guaranteed to perform a lot of players on team Snyder have looked like duds so
        far, most notably Subban and Pavelski. Things in the crease haven't exactly looked great either with his
        cumulative four goalies only posting three wins across the 10 day span, definitely not something you want out of
        your goalie core when wins are so important.

      <h1>Week Nineteen Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="19/02/2019">Feb. 19th, 2019</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The 2019 regular season is almost at an end and what a ride it's been. I don't think there has ever been a more
        competitive league than the 2019 season and I think that's great for both the league and the GMs in it. A few
        teams have already secured their spot either at the top or the bottom of the brackets but a giant question mark
        still remains for many teams stuck in the middle. The remaining two weeks are going to be a matter of
        life-and-death for many .500ish teams.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Vladimir Tarasenko (StL F - 37.0 fpts) - Team Mann (12) </h3>
        As is tradition in fantasy hockey, as soon as Cam traded away Tarasenko he instantly turned into the hottest
        sniper in the NHL. Tarasenko has been nothing short of disgusting and somehow instead of cooling off just keeps
        getting hotter with consecutive multi-point nights.
        <h3><br />
          2. Nikita Kucherov (TB F - 33.6 fpts) - Team Brawn (6) </h3>
        I don't think Geoff is taking home the Henicup this year and Kucherov is most of the reason why, this guy is
        practically a fantasy team by himself. Averaging almost 13 points over the last week is nutty for any fantasy
        player.
        <h3><br />
          3. Sidney Crosby (Pit F - 33.4 fpts) - Team Buckley (10) </h3>
        Crosby making the rounds again at No. 3, while a cut under the level of the truly elite this season Crosby has
        still had really solid production all-in-all.
        <h3><br />
          4. Jordan Binnington (StL G - 31.2 fpts) - Team Scheuermann (22) </h3>
        Team 100% free agency goalie core living up to its name. Tim maybe not have had much luck with Jake Allen but
        Binnington is looking to be everything he wanted in a Blues goaltender, at least for the time being. With the
        offense in St. Louis cranked up to ten you can expect a 'W' pretty much regardless of who's starting so
        Binnington should retain good value as long as he has the starting job locked down.
        <h3><br />
          5. Andrei Vasilevskiy (TB G - 31.0 fpts) - Team Mann (13) </h3>
        Mann strikes again with his signature first round pick. Vasilevskiy still holds the throne as the top fantasy
        goaltender right now even despite earlier setbacks and there's practically no one safer from being challenged
        for the starting gig.
        <h3><br />
          6. Kris Letang (Pit D - 30.8 fpts) - Team Mann (14) </h3>
        Another immensely important piece of Mann's team patched together largely through trades, while Letang comes
        with a lot of inherent risk as long as he can stay healthy on the Pens top PP there's no denying he's an
        offensive monster from the blueline.
        <h3><br />
          7. Evgeni Malkin (Pit F - 26.2 fpts) - Team Erlandson (18) </h3>
        The final member of the Pitsburg Penguins to make the top 10 this week, Malkin has always been a dynamic fantasy
        player and usually a lot more accessible in the draft compared to other elite forwards. Similar to Letang, as
        long as he's healthy he should be producing at a good rate.
        <h3><br />
          8. Alex Pietrangelo (StL D - 25.6 fpts) - Team Brawn (7) </h3>
        For maybe the first time ever team Brawn hits the list twice in a week, granted Pietrangelo is definitely no
        superstar. He's had some ups and downs over the past few years but usually maintains some baseline consistency
        at least (though definitely not enough to warrant a 4th round pick in my opinion). He's really benefitting off
        the recent Blue's offensive surge but I imagine once that fizzles out his points will start to taper off again.
        <h3><br />
          9. Steven Stamkos (TB F - 25.2 fpts) - Team Erlandson (19) </h3>
        Rik's one-two punch from his top forward draft picks really helped him pull ahead in his weekly matchup against
        KV. After debatably underperforming in the 2018 season Stamkos seems to be on regaining some of his former glory
        as one of the best offensive threats in the league.
        <h3><br />
          10. Alex Ovechkin (Wsh F - 24.2 fpts) - Team Larsen (13) </h3>
        Ovechkin is back in the top 10 after seeing a small lull in his performance throughout January. The Russian
        power forward just keeps on delivering no matter how poorly his team is doing.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Scheuermann - <i>Championship Frontrunner</i> (11-8-0)</h3>
        On top of already being known for pretty strong draft's team Scheuermann has found tremendous success
        this year in Free Agency with Chabot still producing at an insane level and now a string of strong performances
        from a purely free agent goalie core. Although the honors of best record in the league go to team Mann I think
        it's still safe to say Team
        Scheuermann is the favourite going into the 2019 Championship. Although he's suffered a few losses lately his
        Points For has spiked to almost 300 fantasy points over second place and nearly 1000 over Mau who is currently
        trailing in last. It's not hard to see why Tim's scoring output has really pulled ahead, so many of his players
        are sporting fantays averages of over 4, he owns most of the top guns on Boston and has a powerhouse of a
        defensive core.

        Honorable mention to Geoff who's name has actually become unironic with the longest winstreak in the league
        right now. Came a little too late though as he's still guaranteed Henicup contention.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Buckley - <i>Henicup Bound?</i> (9-10-0)</h3>
        The East division has been neck and neck this year, culminating in a four team season-end scramble to dodge
        Henicup contention. With Team Leis and Brawn having already secured their spot in the Henicup battle, two more
        people are still
        going to have to bite the bullet. Of those in contention Team Buckey already has the disadvantage of being at 9
        wins instead of 10 compared to other teams and to make matters worse he's on a league-leading 4 week slide.
        Tweak is currently rostering 6 players with an average of under 3 Fantasy Points which is a place you don't
        really want to find yourself when competition is so stiff. Tweak either needs to make some roster shake-ups
        happen or hope he's struggling players turn it around for him in this critical weeks.

      <h1>Week Seventeen Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="04/2/2019">Feb. 2nd, 2019</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Well it's been quite some time since the last wrap-up, while I definitely don't have the time to go back and do
        more write-ups, I have been keeping track of the Top 10 points and continuing to tally those up so they should
        be
        up to date (minus one or two weeks that I forgot to save the data or lost it).
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Jonathan Toews (Chi F - 37.6 fpts) - Team Sunny (12)
        </h3>
        Toews is a rare case where it seems that he has gone from being overrated to underrated in just a few years
        time, everyone always knew he was a talented player but he often didn't pull much weight in the fantasy world.
        For whatever reason that trend seems to be reversing and Toews is hitting the scoresheet a lot more frequently.
        <h3><br />
          2. Patrick Kane (Chi F - 34.0 fpts) - Team Larsen (11) </h3>
        The Kane has looked unstoppable, averaging over 2PPG in his last 29 contests and only missing the scoresheet
        twice in that time. The Blackhawks might be sitting dead last in their division but their offense still
        presents a major threat to any team they go up against.
        <h3><br />
          3. Sebastian Aho (Car F - 28.2 fpts) - Team Snyder (9)
        </h3>
        For being taken so late in the draft and passed around all season in trades, I imagine any uncertainties there
        were about Aho must surely be gone now. There's no denying this kid is a stud and has been playing at an elite
        level almost all season, he seems to be turning it up recently and was crucial in Cam's close victory over
        Tweak.
        <h3><br />
          4. T.J. Oshie (Wsh F - 27.2 fpts) - Team Buckley (7) </h3>
        A solid player to own in any league, especially in banger formats. He might not rack up as many goals with the
        lionshare of those going over to Ovechkin but he's still a potent offensive threat who racks up a lot of
        peripherals.
        <h3><br />
          5. John Carlson (Wsh D - 27.0 fpts) - Team Scheuermann (17) </h3>
        Carlson has been so good and so consistent all season, definitely still one of the best value picks to come out
        of the early-mid rounds. Week after week he continues to accumulate fantasy value working the always-dangerous
        Washington
        powerplay.
        <h3><br />
          6. Robin Lehner (NYI G - 26.6 fpts) - Team Scheuermann (18) </h3>
        After being drafted, traded, dropped and picked up once again, Lehner has come full circle back to Team
        Scheuermann. Though I don't think Tim's goalie situation panned out the way he intended from the start he's got
        to be happy about the recent success of Lehner, he's looked rock solid and racked up a lot of fantasy value in
        the past few weeks.
        <h3><br />
          7. Jacob Trouba (Wpg D - 26.2 fpts) - Team Erlandson (17) </h3>
        Initially going undrafted, Trouba has been making waves on Winnipeg lately. He has seen his value spike
        upward tremendously from the start of December onward, it's unclear how sustainable it is but he doesn't seem
        to be losing any steam yet.
        <h3><br />
          8. Mika Zibanejad (NYR F - 26.0 fpts) - Team Buckley (8) </h3>
        As someone who owned Zibanejad in the past, this guy is sick. Even when he was on Ottawa he seemed to be a
        bright spot on the team, now that's he's moved to the Rangers it seems that his offensive role has grown and
        he's being granted a lot more opportunity.
        <h3><br />
          9. Brent Burn (sSJ D - 25.4 fpts) - Team Le Fevre (15) </h3>
        Big Burnsy with another hit on the list, not surprisingly he's one of the most common players to show up here.
        It's just really hard to match the offensive calibur of Burns from the point, even I was a little skeptic going
        into this year how well he would be able to maintain his monstrous fantasy pace that he's enjoyed in the past
        with his growing age and having to share powerplay prime-time with Karlsson but
        he's still doing it and making it look easy.
        <h3><br />
          10. Leon Draisaitl (Edm F - 25.4 fpts) - Team Larsen (12) </h3>
        Although no longer sharing the same line as McDavid, Draisaitl has still been excellent anchoring his own
        second line. He still gets to play with McDavid on the topPP and that continues to be enough to keep him
        fantasy relevant.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Larsen - <i>Stacked Top-End</i> (9-4-0)</h3>
        Climbing up to second in Points For and sporting a positive win-rate for the first time all season I'm feeling
        pretty good about how my team is shaping
        up. The early season was rough for me but I was finally able to cut lose on a few players holding my team down
        and was able to pick up Stone and Draisaitl who have been great for week-to-week consistency. Although goalies
        and skater depth are a bit of a problem I think my team has the top-end firepower to make up for it. Currently
        there are seven players who are above a 5.0 fpt average and I own three of them, that goes a long way towards
        coming out of the gate strong and securing weeks.
        <br />
        Honorable mention to Evan Mann who is riding a five-game win streak after some mid-season wobbles.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Leis - <i>Henicup Favourite</i> (3-14-0)</h3>
        Underperforming stars in Laine and Kopitar, Halak and Bobrovsky getting annhilated game after game, and a
        roster
        full of skaters who could probably be outperformed by free-agents. With only three wins it's easy to see why
        Team Leis has already clinched his spot in the Henicup bracket. While you can't place all the blame on his as
        there was a certain level of bad luck with some of his early-round picks, he certainly hasn't made much attempt
        to right the ship. Will Leis be able to dodge another defeat this year? We can only hope it comes down
        to the fan-favourite Morgo Vs. Leis Henicup showdown.

        Week 10, back at it again. Check out who's dominating the competition in the Weekly Top 10 and a special look
        at two select teams in the GM spotlight.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Elias Pettersson (Van C - 27.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (10)
        </h3>
        The budding Canucks super-star is looking great right now. It looks like this could definitely be a guy to keep
        an eye on going into the future.
        <h3><br />
          2. Louis Domingue (Chi G - 27 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Sunny (8)
        </h3>
        Sunny continues to rake in fantasy value from Domingue while Vasilevsky remains sidelined. It's hard to say how
        much longer Sunny will be able to squeeze points out of Domingue but he's got to be loving it right now. He was
        definitely played a pivitol part in taking down Team Scheuermann last week.
        <h3><br />
          3. Torey Krug (Bos D - 25.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Sunny (9)
        </h3>
        Here's a defensemen with a lot of hype around him, with the days of Chara holding down the blue line as the
        premier defensemen on the Bruins long gone Krug is doing a great job generating offense from the point.
        <h3><br />
          4. Steven Stamkos (TB C - 25.2 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (13)
        </h3>
        I imagine Stamkos' early season performance must have had Rik sweating a little about the decision to take
        Stamkos round one but it looks like Stammer is starting to rebound and he makes his first appearance on the Top
        10.
        <h3><br />
          5. Mike Smith (Cgy G - 24.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Buckley (5)
        </h3>
        Right after I slam Tweak's G-core and thinking that Rittich is the future in Calgary Smith fires back with a
        huge week including a big shutout against Minnesota. My faith in Smith is still limited but it looks like he's
        still capable of holding down the start position on Calgary.
        <h3><br />
          6. Connor Hellebuyck (Wpg G - 23.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mann (8)
        </h3>
        For the most part Winnipeg has looked rock solid this year, both offensively and defensively. Hellebuyck has
        been one of the more consistent netminders in the 2018 season so far.
        <h3><br />
          7. Carey Price (NYR LW - 23.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Snyder (6)
        </h3>
        Former fantasy giant Carey Price has definitely seen better days, it looks like there's still some value left
        in him on a weaker Canadiens squad though.
        <h3><br />
          7. Johnny Gaudreau (Cgy LW - 23.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (14)
        </h3>
        Johnny Hockey is a sick player with tons of skill. When he's on his game he's a terror and he's definitely
        pushing himself into elite territory this season, I kind of regret not going in on him earlier in the draft but
        he burned me
        a bit two seasons ago and it made me a bit hesitant to reach for him.
        <h3><br />
          9. Sean Monahan (Cgy C - 23.2 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (14)
        </h3>
        A decent player with a pretty cushy line assignment. Monahan is getting a lot of benefit out of Calgary's
        recently surging offense.
        <h3><br />
          10. Elias Lindholm (Cgy C/RW - 23.2fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (15)
        </h3>
        Another Calgary player hits the board and with that team Erlandson takes control over the Top 10 leaderboard.
        The Calgary scoring lines have been looking great and that one-two punch of Johnny/Lindholm must feel great.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team KV - <i>Six win streak</i> (6-4-0)</h3>
        In a surprising twist of events Kyle went from losing the first four games of the season and looking lost to
        springing back to the front of the pack with a huge 6 game win streak. After a stressful string of losses
        followed up by some quick wheeling and dealing KV seems back to his usual status quo of strong playoff
        contender.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Mann - <i>Losing early season momentum</i> (8-2-0)</h3>
        While Mann's record is still great and it would be extremely unlikely for him to miss playoffs or even end up
        in the gauntlet, Mann's meteoric early-season pace cooling off a bit. He's dealing with some very troublesome
        injuries to some big players on his team, namely Vasilevskiy and Klingberg. He's been posting pretty middling
        scores for a few weeks now and it's been a while since he was cracking 200 points on a week-to-week basis. Team
        Mann still has a lot of safety net to work with but he's got to be wondering how he can reclaim some of that
        lost momentum.

      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="03/12/2018">Dec. 3, 2018</time>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Mikko Koskinen (Edm G - 31.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Snyder (5)
        </h3>
        Seeing Koskinen up here has to be a nightmare for team Sunny, Talbot was one of the most utilized starters in
        the NHL but he seems to be almost completely side-lined now in favor of Koskinen. Maybe this is the break Team
        Le Fevre needs to regain some of his lost momentum because this pick-up has looked amazing for him so far and
        could be one of the best of the season if he holds on to his starting job.
        <h3><br />
          2. Mark Scheifele (Wpg C - 31.0 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (8)
        </h3>
        The top Winnipeg line looked great this week and Schiefele was potting goals everywhere and coming up clutch in
        a lot of the games the Jets faced this week. Cam getting him in the bottom of the 5th has seemed like a great
        bargain so far.
        <h3><br />
          3. Nicklas Backstrom (Wsh C - 30.2 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Brawn (4)
        </h3>
        Top line, 1PP on a team known for blowing teams up both when playing at even strength and when on the
        power-play. What's not to love?
        <h3><br />
          4. Nathan MacKinnon (Col C - 29.2 - GP: 3) - Team Menna (6)
        </h3>
        Just another week for MacKinnon, he's looked sick this year and the main powerhouse behind team Menna.
        <h3><br />
          5. Frederik Anderson (Tor G - 26.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team KV (8)
        </h3>
        Matthews is back which naturally bodes well for someone who benefits directly from the overall strength of the
        Toronto club. Additionally, with Nylander finally be signed and back on the roster line combinations might
        finally be solidified, which one would assume leads to more wins for Anderson down the road.
        <h3><br />
          6. Jonathan Huberdeau (Fla LW - 26.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Leis (5)
        </h3>
        Somebody has to fill the void created by the absence of Trocheck. The only problem is that secondary scoring
        lines in Florida are going to be left a lot weaker and the top lines are going to be facing stronger shut-down
        pressure from opposing defenders.
        <h3><br />
          7. Semyon Varlamov (Col G - 23.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Erlandson (11)
        </h3>
        Much to my annoyance Varlamov is still performing great for the Avalanche and while Grubauer does appear to be
        putting up some pretty good nights Varlamov shouldn't be under too much threat if he keeps playing the way he
        is. He's one of the top fantasy goal-tenders who came from a very late draft position, similar to Hutton who is
        also
        on team Erlandson.
        <h3><br />
          8. Oscar Klefbom (Edm D - 25.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Snyder (7)
        </h3>
        Klefbom is one of those guys, just like anyone playing in proximity of McDavid, who has a lot of fantasy value
        on paper. It doesn't hurt that Klefbom shots the puck a ton for a defender. In the past he hasn't really been
        able to shine given the opporunity but there may be a tipping point where he eventually realizes some of that
        value.
        <h3><br />
          9. Brent Burns (SJ D - 23.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Le Fevre (9)
        </h3>
        Burnsy making another appearance albeit a bit lower down the list this time. He's been rock-solid for Morgo all
        season and he's one of the few stand-out players on a slumping Team Le Fevre.
        <h3><br />
          10. Nikolaj Ehlers (Wpg LW - 23.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Menna (7)
        </h3>
        Menna doubling up on Top10 entries this week. Despite looking very unimpressive for most of the season Menna is
        finally rewarded when Ehlers comes through with a hat-trick. It just goes to show you how important 1PP is as
        his linemates Scheifele and Wheeler have so much more value.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Scheuermann - <i>Points For leader</i> (6-3-0)</h3>
        It's the second time team Scheuermann has made the Who's Hot section and for good reason. Points For is always
        going to be one of the best indicators of fantasy success and Tim has a lot of them to go around, he also
        currently holds the title for the most Top10 player awards (13). As it stands right now 12 of Tim's players are
        sporting a fantasy average of 4 FTPS or more per game and that kind of high level consistency is really hard to
        go up against in the regular season. He might still be down Bergeron and Raanta for a while longer but the
        recent addition
        of McElhinney as Carolina's new starter seems to be panning out great for him as a source of new fantasy value.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Sunny - <i>Sliding record</i> (4-5-0)</h3>
        Sunny's team started out red-hot with the leafs looking unstoppable but when Matthews was knocked out of the
        line-up for a while it definitely left his team a little vulnerable. Sunny's record has been tanking a bit in
        the last few weeks
        and he now finds himself at a sub-500 winrate after last week's loss to Varley Jr. Matthews is back now so
        hopefully he can look to get his record
        on track but another big problem has arisen on the senior Varley team in the shape of Cam Talbot. Sunny used up
        an early round draft pick to grab Talbot expecting him to be the primary workhorse for the Oilers 2018-2019
        season but it's looking more and more apparent that he has lost the crease
        to Koskinen.

      <h1>Week Eight Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="19/11/2018">Nov. 19, 2018</time>

        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Patrik Laine (Wpg RW - 51.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Leis (4)
        </h3>
        No player had even broken 40 points in a week yet when Laine comes in and smashes that with an 11 goal, double
        hat trick, 52
        point fantasy week. It's actually insane both in the fantasy world and in the real NHL for someone to
        score 5 goals in a single game, even moreso when you consider this kid is only 20 years old.
        Also Laine and Mau can both eat a dick.
        <h3><br />
          2. Marc-Andre Fleury (Vgs G - 34.3 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Sunny (7)
        </h3>
        It's been a while since Sunny has made Top 10 ever since what happened to Matthews. MAF is still putting up
        solid efforts
        since leaving the Pens and as long as the Vegas offense keeps up the wins should keep coming for him.
        <h3><br />
          3. Braden Holtby (Wsh G - 28.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Buckley (4)
        </h3>
        Holtby has looked lights out since returning, turning away almost 100 shots in his last three games. The
        Caps offense is hot and Holtby is a fantasy stud whenever he takes the crease during these win streaks.
        <h3><br />
          4. Jake Guentzel (Pit LW - 28.0 fpts GP: 4) - Team Le Fevre (7)
        </h3>
        Morgo has earned himself another spot on the Top 10 working his way up to a respectable count of 7 with
        Guentzel hitting the board at the #4 position. Guentzel isn't exactly a fantasy powerhouse but the sheer
        offensive capability means that anyone playing on the Pens has a chance at these big weeks.
        <h3><br />
          5. Louis Domingue (TB G - 27.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Sunny (8)
        </h3>
        Sunny racking up another point with another goalie. Since Vasi has been out with a broken foot Domingue has
        been holding it down for Tampa. Obviously not a fantasy asset that will last but Sunny has to be happy with the
        performance he's getting out of him in the short-term.
        <h3><br />
          6. Max Pacioretty (Vgs LW -26.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Erlandson (10)
        </h3>
        Pacioretty finally showing some signs of life in Vegas, in prior years on the Canadiens Patches had been a
        pretty consistent
        goal-scorer and fantasy asset, his current day production however is much more bleak. We'll see if Patches can
        still turn the season around, this week is a start anyways.
        <h3><br />
          7. Nikita Kucherov (TB RW - 25.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Brawn (3)
        </h3>
        While the Stamkos/Nikita line hasn't been as dominant in past seasons you still can't feel too bad about the
        pace his been on this season. He's well over a point-per-game and performing better than Stamkos overall. Not
        much else to say, he's deadly on the offense and there's a good reason he went in the first round.
        <h3><br />
          8. John Carlson (Wsh D - 25 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (13)
        </h3>
        Carlson has continued to look unbelievable, it makes me wonder if he might even surpass the likes of fantasy
        greats like Karlsson/Burns/Hedman going into next years draft. Either way, Carlson continues to look amazing
        after a great 2017-2018 campaign.
        <h3><br />
          8. Pekka Rinne (Nsh G - 25 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Menna (5)
        </h3>
        We have a tie for 8th place with Pekka Rinne coming in for Menna. It's no secret that a lot of Rinne's value
        stems from
        the amount of starts that Nashville heaps onto him. This week is just an example of Rinne's insane stamina, I
        don't think any other goalies in the leauge are counted on to make four consecutive starts in a single week.
        Rinne ended up walking away with three wins and earning a nice chunk of fantasy points for his efforts.
        <h3><br />
          10. Alex Ovechkin (Wsh RW/LW - 24.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Larsen (5)
        </h3>
        He shoots hard, hits hard and parties hard. His off-season celebration bender didn't seem to slow him down as
        he's currently holding down third place for goals scored and has been an extremely consistent fantasy producer.
        Ovie hits almost as much as he shoots and no other player even comes close to reaching those auxillary point
        thresholds. Ovechkin is scheduled to slow down at some point but it seems like this is not the year.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Buckley - <i>East division leader</i> (6-2-0)</h3>
        I was a bit apprehensive of Team Buckley's record earlier in the season but after 8 weeks he's
        still sitting on top of the East Division and on top of that he hands formerly undefeated team Mann his first
        loss of the season. I think now is when you really got to start looking at Tweak's team as a more serious
        contender, there are definitely some guys on the lower end of his roster than should be axed but there are
        undeniably strong pieces like Crosby, Holtby, Hall and Skinner who are pulling a ton of weight. Holtby is an
        amazing 1G to have
        but I think if Rittich steals the #1 spot on Calgary Tweak's goalie core might be in trouble.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Le Fevre - <i>Four loss streak </i> (3-5-0)</h3>
        Kind of going the opposite way of team Buckley, team Le Fevre was a team I gave a positive review of previously
        on the GM Spotlight
        that I now need to backtrack a little on. Whether it's due to trades not panning out in his favor or bad puck
        luck Team Le Fevre
        has just not been finding a lot of success lately. Granted he has been facing tough opposition, finding himself
        pummeled by
        200+ weeks of opposing clubs, there are still a few issues. Goal-tending woes is definitely one of the bigger
        ones,
        Morgo's crease is in shambles with Murray and Lehner have looking like more of a liability than a source of
        fantasy points in recent weeks. And now to make matters worse
        shortly after trading for Murray from KV he is side-lined with a "longer-term" lower body injury. His forward
        core
        hasn't looked terrible but it's going to need more to overcome the huge deficit that is his current
        goalie core.

      <h1>Week Seven Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="19/11/2018">Nov. 19, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to week seven of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a look at featured GM. It wasn't the most exciting week with lots of low scoring nights and only one team
        cracking the 200 barrier. Worth noting that a lot more goalies ended up on the Top 10 compared to usual.

        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Cam Atkinson (Cls RW - 31.4 fpts - GP: 5) - Team Scheuermann (11)
        </h3>
        Tim is starting to run away with these Top 10 points, Atkinson secures the number one spot this week
        with a hat trick against Carolina. Hard to say if he can keep up a strong pace but it shows Atkinson is
        definitely capable of these big nights every now and then.
        <h3><br />
          2. Corey Crawford (Chi G - 30.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (6)
        </h3>
        Looks like Crawford isn't completely scrambled yet, having the goalie of a team like the Hawks is also great
        for your fantasy but you really got to hope that Crawford doesn't run into further injury complications when it
        comes time for playoffs later down the road.
        <h3><br />
          3. Matt Dumba (Min D - 27.2 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Le Fevre (7)
        </h3>
        I really wish it would have been Dumba instead but it looks like Dumba is doing pretty well on the Wild squad
        right now.
        <h3><br />
          4. Erik Karlsson (SJ D - 26.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (12)
        </h3>
        I really hope Tim was plastered with lowball offers for Karlsson, maybe this week will finally start to restore
        some of his proper fantasy value that has definitely deminished a bit with all the uncertainty of how Karlsson
        is settling in on his new team and sharing key minutes and power play opportunity with Burns.
        <h3><br />
          5. Keith Kinkaid (NJ G - 24 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mann (7)
        </h3>
        Keith is a guy I've rolled from time and time and usually been pretty happy with his performance as a
        short-term option or when NJ has a lot of match-ups. You'd expect Schneider to be the workhorse for SJ but he's
        looked so bad lately that you never know.
        <h3><br />
          6. Brayden Point (TB C - 23.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (13)
        </h3>
        Somehow Point has made it on the list twice before even one showing from Stamkos or Kucherov who both went very
        early in the draft. He's really gotta get rid of that 'stache though.
        <h3><br />
          7. Chris Kreider (NYR LW - 23.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Snyder (4)
        </h3>
        I typically don't like to roster NYR forwards that much, it just seems like they never have those really strong
        one-two punch kind of first and second lines but rather just have their offense evenly spread across their
        lines. While this isn't a bad thing for real life hockey, it doesn't breed great conditions for
        for fantasy value, of course it's still bound to happen every now and then though.
        <h3><br />
          8. Joe Pavelski (SJ C/RW - 22.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Varley (7)
        </h3>
        Joe Pav has always been a fantasy mainstay, even though he dropped all the way down to the lower rounds of the
        draft he's showing he's still capable of some hot weeks.
        <h3><br />
          9. Mikko Koivu (Min G - 23.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Erlandson (9)
        </h3>
        Now heres a guy who hasn't been in the spotlight for a while, oddly enough the aging guard of Minnesota seem to
        be coming back to life from their secondary scoring roles with Koivu and Parise having surprisingly good
        seasons so far.
        <h3><br />
          10. Ben Bishop (Wpg/Tor - 22.2fpts - GP: 2) - Team Leis (3)
        </h3>
        Big Bishop has never quite retained the elite status that he held when he was the Tampa workhorse but it's
        still pretty damn good on the stars. Dallas pulls a decent amount of wins for him usually and he sports a
        pretty good SV% most of the time. With how poor Bob has been playing Mau must be relieved to have at least
        goalie doing okay.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team KV - <i>Three win streak</i> (3-4-0)</h3>
        Clawing his way back from an abysmal start to the season which almost led him to 5 straight defeats, KV's
        finally doing what he's best known for, making trades and it's starting to show in the results. KV looks to
        secure himself his fourth win in a row and his weeks are looking stronger and stronger as he makes his way back
        up the PF leaderboard to where he normally resides. He's definitely holding a lot of hot players right now and
        I wouldn't be surprised if he's still trying to offload one or two of them around the league. Pasta, Rantanen
        and Giroux are looking like they can carry his offense if the other positions of his line-up fall into place.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Larsen - <i>Loss by bench</i> (3-4-0)</h3>
        It goes without saying that failure to set bench is always looked down upon in the league whether you're a
        rookie or veteran. While it happens to everyone from time to time you definitely feel the sting of humiliation
        a lot more in the rare instance when it actually costs you the 'W'. Even looking past that, player stats for
        the last two weeks hasn't looked great. Kane and Benn who I expected to be big power picks aren't producing
        nearly as I'd hoped hovering just barely over 3fpts in recent weeks. Even Trocheck and Panarin aren't producing
        at levels you would expect from them. It's a bit worrisome when you sacrifice so much in the G and D
        departments for your stacked forward core to not really do that much for you.

      <h1>Week Six Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="12/11/2018">Nov. 12, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to week six of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a look at featured GM. Scoring this week really blew up with one of the highest scoring weeks we've seen
        so far.

        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. David Pastrnak (Bos LW/RW - 31.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team KV (4)
        </h3>
        Pasta was blowing up teams this week with five goals recorded over four contests. Pasta has been rock solid so
        far this year as you would expect out of the top Boston line.
        <h3><br />
          2. Thomas Chabot (Ott D - 28 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (8)
        </h3>
        Chabot has had a pretty meteoric rise in the fantasy world, so far he's had no problem filling the void left by
        the departure of Karlsson.
        <h3><br />
          3. Mark Stone (Ott RW - 26.2 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Mann (6)
        </h3>
        Another guy stepping up for the Sens, Stone has looked great so far for Ottawa. Another deeper forward pick for
        Mann that's been pivotal in his success so far this season.
        <h3><br />
          4. Claude Giroux (Phi C - 25 fpts - GP: 3) - Team KV (5)
        </h3>
        Former 100-point breaker fantasy monster Claude Giroux is still finding pretty decent success so far in the
        season. We'll see if he can maintain the heights he reached last season.
        <h3><br />
          5. Oliver Ekman-Larsson (Ari D - 23.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (8)
        </h3>
        OEL is one of those guys who you know has a lot of talent but it's hard to forget that
        he play for a complete dumpster fire of a team (see also Clayton Keller). That being said with
        +/- penalties reduced that doesn't carry as much of a burden as it would have say last year.
        <h3><br />
          6. Sean Couturier (Phi C - 23.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (9)
        </h3>
        While his performance so far this season hasn't been inspiring Couturier definitely had a hot week alongside
        Giroux. Even if his AVG points are hovering a little low it's hard to deny he has a great line assignment.
        <h3><br />
          7. Max Domi (Mon C - 22.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Snyder (2)
        </h3>
        Domi was dishing out helpers everywhere this week ending with a total of 6. The young playmaker is seeing
        pretty consistent production so far.
        <h3><br />
          7. Brian Elliot (Phi G - 22.8 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Scheuermann (10)
        </h3>
        Though Elliot has put up some pretty bad stats his string of starts over the past month or so have looked
        strong. He even shut out the Hawks earlier in the week which is no easy thing to do.
        <h3><br />
          9. Mikael Granlund (Min C - 22.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Brawn (2)
        </h3>
        Granlund was a guy who I took a few chances on in past seasons but he never really seemed to take off, it seems
        this is the year he's finally starting to find his groove. His sporting pretty good peripherals and running at
        a fantasy AVG of over four points so far this season. Not bad at all for later round pick.
        <h3><br />
          10. Mark Scheifele / Frederik Andersen (Wpg/Tor - 22 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Snyder (3) / Team KV (6)
        </h3>
        There were actually five players who tied for the final spot with 22 points, I decided I would award the last
        spot to whoever had the higher AVG on the week, however Anderson and Scheifele both had an average of exactly
        11 so I decided to award two points.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Mann - <i>Early season domination</i> (6-0-0)</h3>
        Now that the wrap-up has been ongoing for a while it's inevitible that some teams would start to appear twice
        on the GM discussion. There's really no better candidate to look at than Mann, he's had one of the best early
        season starts in the history of the league and what's more impressive is that it's not even a case of lucky
        match-ups, Mann's team is putting up huge scores week after week and a lot of his pieces look like they are
        sustainable or even projected to improve. With his early record, barring complete disaster Mann is probably
        already a solid lock for playoffs.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Menna - <i>One transaction all season</i> (3-3-0)</h3>
        Menna is one of the six teams currently sporting a 500 record which of course doesn't inherently make his team
        bad. His draft was reasonable and so far his PF levels have also been middle of the pack. The real reason Menna
        is here is because of the way he runs his fantasy, it's very similar to the way Cass used to back when he
        was in the league. Menna's line-up is almost set in stone,
        he doesn't try to make trades, look for FA gems or even stream players in close match-ups. There are several
        players on his team who are putting up season totals in the low 2's and even high 1's in some cases. These are
        guys that definitely should have already been cut from his team if he wants to really push for a competitive
        spot in the league.
        <h4><br />
          Pick'Em Prohpet<br />

      <h1>Week Five Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="05/11/2018">Nov. 5, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to week five of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a look at featured GMs, and see who's got the best predictions. Interestingly there's not many stars
        to be see this week, the Top 10 is populated mostly by some secondary scorers on lucky streaks as most of the
        dominant scorers in
        the league were pretty quiet.

        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Elias Lindholm (Cgy C/RW - 28.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (6)
        </h3>
        The Calgary top line really did some damage this week with Lindholm really reaping the benefits. Hard to
        complain
        when a free agent pick-up ends up netting you almost 30 points in one week.
        <h3><br />
          2. Ryan McDonagh (TB D - 28.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Erlandson (7)
        </h3>
        Erlandson is making a pretty good push for Top 10 leader with another entry in McDonagh. Former ranger was
        never overly impressive
        in past years but maybe his current line assignment could be a lot more favorable for him.
        <h3><br />
          3. Mark Giordano (Cgy D - 27.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Larsen (4)
        </h3>
        Looks like Gio still has some gas left in the tank, 6 points in a week as well as a point-per-game pace so far
        this season. It's unlikely he'll hold this pace but the veteran is still logging big minutes and making an
        impact on the ice.
        <h3><br />
          4. Cam Fowler (Ana D - 27.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Snyder (1)
        </h3>
        With Cam finally entering the top 10 I believe that means everyone is now on the board. D-men seem to really be
        killing it this week, Fowler notches 3 goals in week which is a pretty impressive number for someone you'd
        probably
        expect to playing more of a shut down role.
        <h3><br />
          5. Sean Monahan (Col RW - 26.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (5)
        </h3>
        The third member of the Calgary squad to land on the list. Ironically the guy you expect to be generating the
        value, Johnny Gaudreau, is absent form
        the list and instead we have Monahan. Sean will have good fantasy value as long as he sits on the top line/1PP
        and it's unlikely anything will shake him from that role.

        <h3><br />
          6. Elias Pettersson (Van C - 25.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (6)
        </h3>
        Petterson is back to a great start after a quick injury hiatus, my guess if you were interested in trading this
        guy from Tim the
        price just went up. Elias managed 5 points in a single night which a lot of elite players even struggle to do,
        this guy could be
        the real deal for a sans Sedin Vancouver.
        <h3><br />
          7. Pekka Rinne (Nsh G - 25.2 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Menna (4)
        </h3>
        Rinne has been the preds workhorse for years and despite being 36 now it looks like he's still going strong.
        Rinne turned away 65 out 66 shots he faced in his first
        two games back from injury.
        <h3><br />
          8. Dylan Larkin (Det C - 24.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team KV (3)
        </h3>
        Another late round pick showing up huge, the Detroit offense does not look good this season, they just don't
        really have that many
        big offensive threats now that the glory days of Datsyuk/Zetterberg have come to an end. Larkin is basically
        one of the only players on Detroit who
        you can expect to get any consistent fantasy value out of.

        <h3><br />
          9. Brayden Point (TB C - 23.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (7)
        </h3>
        It was a good week for Team Scheuermann as Point makes for his third entry on the Top 10. After a great season
        for me last year I was
        looking for Point in the draft but he went over to Tim before I could get the chance. Even though he's on the
        second line the lightning has such terrifying offense on their
        top line that he's likely never going to go up against top shutdown lines which helps him generate a lot of
        offense.
        <h3><br />
          10. Patrik Laine (StL Rw, C - 23.2 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Leis (2)
        </h3>
        Laine finally explodes into action after looking terrible for most of the beginning of the season. Laine hits
        the top ten despite
        only playing two games after scoring a hat trick in a huge night against Florida.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Scheuermann - <i>Consistent performance </i> (3-2-0)</h3>
        Now while Tim did suffer two losses early on in the season I think you gotta give credit where credit is due,
        Tim has the championship-winning
        pedigree and a ton of hockey knowledge. Most of the season Tim's team has bounced between average and high
        scores, his team doesn't often
        suffer really bad weaks because I think he's made a solid team that's well balanced across the positions and
        NHL teams. Tim has established a really
        solid floor for his team which still threatens high scoring weeks if you get unlucky. He was probably hoping
        for more out of his first round pick but there's still
        a lot of season left for Karlsson to start generating some more value.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Buckley - <i>Inflated record</i> (3-2-0)</h3>
        Now what I mean by inflated is that I think that Tweak is one of the teams that has gotten off to a hot start
        that
        will start to come to earth sooner rather than later.
        Right now Tweak is posting a positive win rate despite being the 4th lowest teams for points for, in fact he's
        only 60 points off the current lowest point leader(the title is held by Cam whos situation is similar).

      <h1>Week Four Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="29/10/2018">Oct. 29, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to week four of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a look at featured GMs, and see who's got the best predictions. The standings are quite interesting so far
        with some top spots going to unlikely GMs. However it's important to realize that it's early in the season and
        there are
        definitely some discrepancies between total PF and current record and I expect that by week 10 there should be
        a much clearer
        picture of who's making the top 6 playoff spots and who's running the gauntlet or finding themselves in Henicup
        contention.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Brent Burns (SJ D - 29.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (3)
        </h3>
        I'm sure a lot of people were curious how the Burns/Karlsson would pan out but so far it looks like
        Burns is winning out fantasy-wise. Burns has always been one of the top-performers in the league
        and this is proof why, 6 points in a week is a lot of fantasy value for skaters who get access to those extra
        DEF points. Of course because it's Burns you know a lot of those are coming on the PP as well.
        <h3><br />
          2. Filip Forsberg (Nsh C/LW - 27.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (4)
        </h3>
        Morgo picks up the second spot as well with Forsberg who potted 5 goals on the week. The young Swede
        has a ton of talent and you can expect a lot of the offensive coming out of Nashville to be generated by him.
        <h3><br />
          3. Sidney Crosby (Pit C - 27 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Buckley (3)
        </h3>
        Honestly there are times where I've felt like Crosby was a little overvalued as a first-round pick in fantasy
        because he tends to
        accumulate more assists than goals but that's definitely not the case this week after tallying five goals in
        three games on top of two assists.
        <h3><br />
          4. Connor McDavid (Edm C - 26.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Leis (1)
        </h3>
        It took four weeks but Mau has finally landed on the top 10, of course owning McDavid meant this moment was
        inevitable. McDavid broke 400 Fpts last year, it's insane to think that there's even potential to improve on
        that even exists.
        <h3><br />
          5. Mikko Rantanen (Col RW - 25.6 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Mann (4)
        </h3>
        The Colorado offense has been crushing it lately, for an 8th round pick Rantanen has been performing
        great for Mann. As long as he keeps playing with MacKinnon he should keep producing at a good rate.

        <h3><br />
          6. Mark Scheifele (Wpg C - 25 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Snyder (1)
        </h3>
        Another new GM on the top 10 as Cam makes his first appearance. Scheifele enjoyed an easy schedule last week
        playing four games against teams that tend to let a lot
        of pucks in. Scheifele didn't have any massive games but rather just consistly contributed to all 4 of his
        games played.
        <h3><br />
          7. Timo Meier (SJ LW/RW - 24 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (5)
        </h3>
        The Sharks have so much offense that even players on secondary scoring lines can rack up a lot of
        fantasy points. Despite not getting top line pairings he still gets to play even-strength with Couture and
        earns a little bit of 2PP time.
        <h3><br />
          8. Anders Lee (NYI C/LW - 23.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mann (5)
        </h3>
        I think a lot of people expected the value of Lee to plummet with the trading of Tavares but as much
        as a fantasy boon it was to play with Tavares you also need to consider that his departure leaves a huge
        gap in production that needs to be filled by someone. Lee isn't a flashy player but he still manages to get a
        lot of points grinding the dirty zones in front of the net.
        <h3><br />
          9. Patrick Kane (Chi R - 22.8 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Larsen (3)
        </h3>
        The Chicago offense continues to look alive and thriving, Kane already has 19 points so far this season, will
        he be able to return back to the glory days of his 100 point season after a disappointing 2018 campaign?
        <h3><br />
          10. Ryan O'Reilly (StL Rw, C - 22.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Erlandson (5)
        </h3>
        The Blues seem to be going through a bit of a rough patch to start the season off but it doesn't seem to be
        effecting
        ROR this week. He came out strong with 6 points and +6 rating.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Le Fevre - <i>leads league in goals </i> (3-1-0)</h3>
        Sporting a pretty nice 3-1 opening record must be feeling pretty good considering his past legacy of Henicup
        contention.
        It's hard to give him too much credit seeing as his team was basically auto-drafted but so far his players have
        been on a great scoring run,
        he leads the league in goals scored as well as hat tricks. Definitely the kind of categories you want to target
        during the regular season. Overall Morgo's PF is average so it's likely that at his current rate he won't hold
        one of the top division spots for long but its still possible that Morgo avoids the Henicup race this year and
        establishes himself as a mid-tier team.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Leis - <i>Winless, lowest PF </i>(0-0-4)</h3>
        I'm a little bit surprised as I thought relative to his other seasons his draft actually seemed to be not that
        terrible however it really seems like Mau's team is just snakebitten right now. Mau has so many underperforming
        players on his team currently, not to mention his 2nd round pick, Laine was recently demoted to the 4th line.
        Other players like Kopitar, Hamilton and Provorov are also doing poorly out of the gate. To make matters worse,
        Radulov, one of his more consistent players is out on injury right now. Until his players start picking it up
        Mau is really looking like a free win.

      <h1>Week Three Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="22/10/2018">Oct. 22, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Here we go again with another week of the Fantasy wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice, a quick look at featured GM's in the league and now introducing a new segment the Pick'Em Prophet. As of
        last week the site now features a new match-ups section with a recently renovated look, in the wrap-up we're
        going to see who had the best predictions over the last week.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Gabriel Landeskog (Col LW - 35.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Erlandson (2)
        </h3>
        Team Erlandson came out in force this week, refusing to be taken down to an 0-0-3 start. Landeskog
        earned more than 10 more fantasy points than the second ranked player on the list and played a huge role in
        Erik's monster 238 point week. At only 25, Landeskog is looking like he could demolish
        past career highs playing with the likes of Mackinnon and Rantanen.
        <h3><br />
          2. Jeff Skinner (Buf LW - 24 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Buckley (2)
        </h3>
        Skinner has a pretty nice line assignment playing with up-and-coming star Jack Eichel. Skinner has
        traditionally
        looked good in past seasons but it always seems like it's just a matter of time before a random head shot
        takes him out for the season.
        We'll see if Skinner can make it safely through the 2019 season but I wouldn't bet on it.


        <h3><br />
          3. Logan Couture (SJ C - 23.4 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Sunny (6)
        </h3>
        Couture was a force of nature out on the ice this week landing at the 3rd spot with only two games played.
        Couture is one of those
        guys who always seems poised to have a huge breakout into elite status every year but it never quite comes to
        fruition. That being
        said his floor has always been pretty solid and he presents a lot of potential upside for a ninth round pick.
        Also worth noting that
        Couture is the first non-leaf to earn a top 10 point for Sunny.
        <h3><br />
          4. Nathan MacKinnon (Col C - 22.6 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Menna (3)
        </h3>
        Menna is quietly acruing top 10 points with another from MacKinnon. There's no doubt MacKinnon is a monster and
        is likely
        to frequent the wrap-up all season long after his huge break out last season. He dishes out a little bit of
        everything and
        drives a lot of the Colorado offense, he's a very safe bet to finish the season as a top 10 skater overall.
        <h3><br />
          5. Zach Parise (Min LW - 21 fpts - GP: 4) - Team KV (2)
        </h3>
        With a four game schedule it was a smart move for KV to pick up Parise at the start of the week but I don't
        think anyone
        would have expected him to be this week. You definitely have to give a special shout-out when a FA acquisition
        lands
        so high on the top 10 board. Parise's 10 blocked shots accounted for 4 fpts (roughly 20% of his weekly fpts)
        which is an absurdly high number for a forward. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to take home the 'W' for KV but
        you
        still gotta give props.

        <h3><br />
          6. Juuse Saros (Nsh G - 21 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Mann (3)
        </h3>
        The first goalie to grace Week 3 of the weekly top ten is who? None other than Nashville back-up Juuse Saros on
        relief duty
        for Pekka Rinne. Saros actually picks up a very easy win after stopping the remaining 9 shots against Calgary
        in the game
        that Rinne was injured. He did
        earn his spot here however by turning away 31 shots from McDavid and Co. Saros is definitely turing out to be a
        good
        goalie to
        stream in the absence of Rinne.
        <h3><br />
          7. Tyler Johnson (TB C/RW - 21.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Scheuermann (4)
        </h3>
        Damn this guy puts a lot of pucks on net, Johnson fired exactly 17 this week which is what you want to see out
        of a player
        on a high-octane
        offensive team like the Lightning. Johnson has no assists to speak of this week but you're definitely going to
        value
        those G's higher anyways. A quick short-handed goal doesn't hurt to pump up your weekly stats either.
        <h3><br />
          8. Keith Yandle (Fla D - 20.2 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Brawn (1)
        </h3>
        After 3 weeks Geoff finally earns a spot on the wrap-up (well technically he gets one more mention but we'll
        get to that later). It must have been a little troubling to see Florida rolling out a 5 Forward power-play unit
        without Yandle at the start of the season but it looks like he's doing alright now contributing a healthy
        amount of
        stats across the board including 5 points.
        <h3><br />
          9 (Tie). Devan Dubnyk (Min G - 20 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Larsen (3)
        </h3>
        Dubnyk is in my opinion quite under-rated, he currently sits second overall among fantasy tenders. While the
        wild are not
        a particularly dominant team, Dubnyk always tends to post a pretty good SV% and GAA. Dubnyk has no #2 breathing
        down his neck
        and will take on the majority of starts, it's just up to the Wild to win the games so Dubnyk can reap the
        points for the 'W'.
        <h3><br />
          9 (Tie). P.K. Subban (Nsh D - 20 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Erlandson (3)
        </h3>
        Though it's a bit surprising to see Subban with only 1 hit throughout the whole week he's still putting a lot
        of shots on net which
        is to be expected from the talented offensive blue-liner. A lot of Subban's fantasy value this week comes from
        a break out end-to-end
        short-handed goal beating the Edmonton goalie with a quick snap through the 5-hole.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Mann - <i>Pun game on point</i> (3-0-0)</h3>
        The reigning Basecamp Fantasy Champion is starting the new season hot picking up wins in all of his contests so
        far. He looks to continue
        his win streak against a battered (0-0-3) Kyle Varley. Despite an unorthodox draft where he didn't even pick up
        his first forward until the 5th round he is somehow generating tons of offense from his mid and late round
        picks. Ironically
        his first and second round goalie picks have been sub-par so far which means that his team is still capable of
        being even stronger once
        they eventually rebound and start playing well. Mann has gotten a lot of unexpected value out of the likes of
        Petry and Saros but these will obviously come
        to an end once their injured counter-parts bump them back down the line-up. You really got to respect what Mann
        brings to the name game, fantasy Team Names have always been a cornerstone of the BCFL and Mann has been
        bringing his A-game
        so far this season.
        <br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Brawn - <i>Hard shell taco enthusiast </i>(0-0-3)</h3>
        Geoff is the only other member of the league to remain winless after three contests, the only difference
        between him and KV is that is actually
        seems like he might actually stay that way. Fuck this seems pretty fitting when you consider that Geoff is
        almost already at a -100 point differential
        between him and his opponnents by only the third week. Geoff's draft is mostly to blame with a lot of his
        mid-round picks hardly performing better
        than what's currently available on FA. The only thing that I like about Geoff's team is that he's still trying
        to make moves to patch up his squad. He recently picked up Lowry from the Jets who have an amazing four game
        schedule this week and I think could
        could end up being a pretty smart move for Geoff in the short-term.

      <h1>Week Two Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="15/10/2018">Oct. 15, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome back to the second week of the Basecamp Fantasy Wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the
        ice and a quick look at featured GM's in the league. More than half of this week's top line-up is made by
        Boston/Toronto, I added a games played metric to the top 10 and we'll be looking at the Varley brothers in the
        GM Spotlight.
        <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Patrice Bergeron (Bos C - 34 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (2)
        </h3>
        The fact that the top spot this week goes to Bergeron despite only getting in 3 games compared to the leafs 4
        is pretty impressive. The Boston offense was firing on all cylinders this week, though it could be argued that
        they didn't face very tough opposition. Bergeron killed it across multiple cats including a hat trick against
        Ottawa earlier in the week.
        <h3><br />
          2. David Pastrnak (Bos LW/RW - 32 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (2)
        </h3>
        Pasta grants Morgo his debut on the top 10 with a whopping 6 goals including a hat trick against detroit. He
        wasn't as active in the assist column but with those kind of points you probably aren't going to care too much.
        Pastrnak has been one of the more consistent fantasy powerhouses in the last few seasons and it definitely
        won't be his last time up here.
        <h3><br />
          3. Auston Matthews (Tor C - 26.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Sunny (4)
        </h3>
        Matts once again finding himself high up on the board, it doesn't hurt that the leafs got to enjoy four games
        this week. It's really looking
        like the offensive core of the leafs are going to be more or less permenant mainstays on the top 10 which has
        to have Sunny feeling pretty good about his team.
        <h3><br />
          4. Sebastion Aho (Car RW/C - 24 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Mann (2)
        </h3>
        Despite never fully realizing his potential last year Mann takes another chance on Aho and it seems to be
        paying off so far.
        Aho put up a huge variety of stats this week, getting a surprising number of hits and blocks in as well which
        are definitely a nice bonus on top of the regular point production Aho offers.
        <h3><br />
          5. Phil Kessel (Pit RW - 23.2 fpts - GP: 4) - Team KV (1)
        </h3>
        Kessel seems to be settling in much better on the Penguins where he's out of the main spotlight with the likes
        of Crosby and Malkin around. Kessel still has a wicked shot and lots of opportunities playing with the Pens to
        quietly rack up a lot of points. He also marks KV's entry on the top 10 board.
        <h3><br />
          6. David Perron (Stl LW - 22 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Le Fevre (2)
        </h3>
        Morgo had a huge 200+ week partially due to his FA pick-up of Perron. At just 20% owned Morgo definitely got
        some value out of this guy as he notches a hat trick against the Calgary squad. Whether not Morgo could have
        anticipated
        the impact of Perron, he definitely played a crucial role in his close match-up over KV.
        <h3><br />
          7. John Tavares (Tor C - 21.4 fpts - GP: 4) - Team Sunny (5)
        </h3>
        Sunny is really starting to break away on the top 10 here, already at 5 points as Tavares hits the board for
        the second week in a row.
        With how stacked the Toronto offense is looking a third week wouldn't surprise me.
        <h3><br />
          8. Evgeny Kuznetsov (Wsh C - 20.4 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Menna (2)
        </h3>
        The Russian stud making his first appearance in week 2. He's flanked by the likes of Ovechkin and capable
        of scoring goals and dishing out assists equally, Kuznetsov is about as safe as it comes for guaranteed weekly
        production.
        <h3><br />
          9. Brad Marchand (Bos LW - 18.8 fpts - GP: 3) - Team Scheuermann (3)
        </h3>
        Loved by few, hated by many, but undeniably a rock solid fantasy producer. For a while it seemed like there was
        a period where
        no one could really believe he was an elite fantasy prospect but synergy in Boston among the top 6 and PP has
        really
        clicked and Marchand has a fat assist column to show for it.
        <h3><br />
          10. Alex DeBrincat (Chi RW - 18.8 fpts - GP: 2) - Team Menna (3)
        </h3>
        The sole player with only two games played to make the top 10, DeBrinecat has played a large role in the
        rejuvination of the
        Chicago offense. He's really proving himself playing alongside top talent on the Blackhawks, for being such a
        late pick in the draft he could end up being a clutch sleeper pick for Menna.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Varley (Sr.) - <i>Two win streak</i> (2-0-0)</h3>
        If there were ever a year to be a leafs homer in a fantasy league this is it. The leafs offense looks almost
        unstoppable and Sunny somehow ended up with all the core pieces minus maybe Marner. After losing against Sunny
        earlier in the week I got to say you really dread every night there's a leaf game because you know his guys can
        net 20-30 points easily in one game. That being said, the traditional weaknesses of stacking up on one team
        still apply;
        whenever the leafs find themselves with a light schedule it's hard to say if Sunny's team has the depth to
        stand up to the
        other powerhouses in the league. I don't think the leafs offense will ever find itself completely shut down so
        I think he
        should be safe from that at least.
        <br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Varley (Jr.) - <i>Two loss streak</i> (0-0-2)</h3>
        Three-time Basecamp Fantasy Champion finds himself in a less-than-ideal situation as the beginning of the
        season unfolds. Back-to-back losses is a bad spot to find yourself at the start of the season, especially
        with a tough
        match-up against former Champion Evan Mann just around the corner, but other GMs
        have come back from worse. KV is undoubtedly upset with the situation having taken to WhatsApp to express his
        outrage over his close defeat to
        Team Le Fevre. The only positive spin is that in terms of points for, which are usually a more accurate measure
        of strength, KV is still
        putting up a decent performance.

      <h1>Week One Fantasy Wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Wrap-up</h2>

      <time datetime="08/10/2018">Oct. 8, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome to the first official Basecamp Fantasy Wrap-up, a weekly analysis of who's showing up on the ice and a
        quick look at featured GM's in the league. You can expect one of these coming your way every week, where I'll
        be ranking the weekly top 10 players in the league based on fantasy points and awarding points to their
        respective owners. <br />
        <h4>
          Weekly top 10<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>
          1. Auston Matthews (Tor C - 30 fpts) - Team Sunny (1)
        </h3>
        What a monstrous week for Big Papi netting a league leading 5 goals and 3 assists to boot. Taken once again in
        the first round by Sunny, there's no way the addition of Tavares doesn't boost the firepower of the leafs and
        push Matthews to even higher heights.
        <h3><br />
          2. Morgan Rielly (Tor D - 29.4 fpts) - Team Sunny (2)
        </h3>
        Not who you would expect to top the fantasy charts for D-men going into week 2 but here he is. Definitely got a
        big boost from the 7 goal game against Chicago, we'll see how much he can improve on last year's season.
        <h3><br />
          3. Jonathan Toews (Chi C - 26.4 fpts) - Team Sunny (3)
        </h3>
        Perhaps the most surprising player to land on the top 10 is Toews, who has become notorious over the years for
        having bad fantasy value despite being a great real-life player. Most of his points were generated from his hat
        trick against St. Louis. Considering he was drafted 171st overall, if Chicago can keep ramping up its offense
        Toews could turn out to be an insane value pick for Sunny.
        <h3><br />
          4. John Gibson (Ana G - 24 fpts) - Team Erlandson (1)
        </h3>
        Gibson is a goalie with a crazy amount of upside, I really Rik's move to grab a goalie like Gibson in the 3rd
        who can easily compete with the elite goalies who went in earlier rounds and free up his 1st and 2nd picks for
        other positions.
        <h3><br />
          5. Patrick Kane (Chi RW - 23 fpts) - Team Larsen (1)
        </h3>
        The former first rounder got passed by until the third round after a lackluster 2017-2018 season and on a team
        with deteriorating offensive capabiltiies. So far he's proving he still has what it takes to be elite.
        <h3><br />
          6. John Tavares (Tor C - 21.8 fpts) - Team Sunny (4)
        </h3>
        Sunny's 4th player to hit the top 10 and rank 6 overall, John Tavares. Tavares is wasting no time adjusting by
        scoring a hat trick against the blackhawks, with the sheer amount of offensive power the leafs have this season
        I expect Tavares to be a regular customer on the top 10.
        <h3><br />
          7. T.J. Oshie (Wsh C/RW - 20.4 fpts) - Team Buckley (1)
        </h3>
        Oshie will bump Team Buckley onto the scoreboard but I don't particularly expect to see him up here too often.
        That being said Oshie has good stat coverage and the Capitals 1PP is dangerous.
        <h3><br />
          8. John Carlson (Wsh D - 19.2 fpts) - Team Scheuermann (1)
        </h3>
        A great 4th round pick in my opinion, Carlson put up career high points last year and at I don't expect much in
        the way of regression.
        <h3><br />
          9. Tyler Seguin (Dal C - 18.8 fpts) - Team Menna (1)
        </h3>
        Everyone knows the Benn/Seguin duo is deadly, particularly on the PP. I expect to see these two guys up here a
        lot this season.
        <h3><br />
          10. Kris Letang (Pit D - 18.8 fpts) - Team Mann (1)
        </h3>
        Sucks for Morgo.
        <h4><br />
          GM Spotlight<br />
        </h4>
        <h3>Who's hot: Team Erlandson</h3>
        Despite being handed a tough loss in week 1 by Sunny in a crazy Sunday comeback I think you can't really ignore
        the second highest score and that Rik has a team worth watching out for this year. Rik has been setting a trend
        of progressively becoming more and more of a playoff threat each passing year. His forward core is super solid
        with a one two punch of Malkin and Stamkos, and despite getting burned by him once myself I think he got a good
        deal on Gaudreau. As far as goalies go I think Gibson makes up for most of the shortcomings of his weaker 2nd
        and 3rd goalies. I'm not really sold on all of his D choices but it's still early in the year.
        <br />
        <h3>Who's not: Team Snyder</h3>
        Traditionally speaking Cam has always managed a middle of the pack team that usually goes through highs and
        lows throughout the season. Recently however he has come under fire for his draft strategy and despite picking
        up the 'W' his team had a poor first showing. Additionally, a string of early injuries to his core roster
        threatens to set him back early, definitely not a comfortable position for a regular bubble team. I actually
        don't think Cam did a bad job at all at balancing his team, it's fairly even across the positions, the only
        problem I have is that it seemed like he never really managed to any strong power picks in the middle rounds
        which just sort of leaves his team a little lacking overall.

      <h1>2018 Balance Changes</h1>
      <h2>League Announcement</h2>

      <time datetime="13/9/2018">Sept. 13, 2018</time>
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>So after some balance talks with Tim we decided to go ahead with the following balance change:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>+/- (0.5 points) &rArr; +/- (0.2 points)</b>
        <br />
        <br /> The reason for the change was that we both felt that the plus minus stat as a whole was something we
        wanted to keep
        in the league but at the same time it felt a little too random, esepcially with forwards ending with negative
        nights.
        We decided to lower the impact of +/- to make players fantasy nights a little more consistent across the board.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also talked about trying to make goalies more consistent and and make lower end goalies a bit less risky to
        run out by
        reducing negative points acrued by goals against (while reducing points earned for wins) but it turned out to
        be
        too hard to balance without throwing off the balance of the elite goaltenders. We also didn't want to shake up
        the
        balance of the league too much right before the draft so we decided to keep the changes fairly light this year
        as
        we were mostly happy with how everything turned out last year.

      <p>Thanks again to KV for doing the annual draft lottery, I've added last year's draft position in brackets next
        to each
        name. This year's Basecamp Fantasy Hockey League draft pick order is as follows:
        <br />
        <br /> 1. Matt Leis (3)
        <br /> 2. Sunny Varley (1)
        <br /> 3. Geoff Charles (2)
        <br /> 4. Curtis Larsen (4)
        <br /> 5. Morgan Pierre (9)
        <br /> 6. Tim Aaron (6)
        <br /> 7. Erik Menna (11)
        <br /> 8. Morgan Noel (12)
        <br /> 9. Cameron RS (10)

        <br /> 11. Kyle Varley (8)
        <br /> 12. Evan Mann (7)
        <br />
        <br /> It's interesting to see that the top four draft picks remain unchanged and that most GMs ended up with a
        pick position
        relatively close to last year's. Rik being the only outlier here dropping five positions 5 > 10.
